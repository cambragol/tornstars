1. install 7-zip

2. install ispack

3. decide on a location to put the installer system. As my EoC home directory was c:\games\EoC_EPIC, I chose C:\games\EoC_EPIC\EpicInstaller

4. Extract the archive to this location

5. Decide on where the source files that get put into the installer will be located. I just took them from the mods directory. C:\games\EoC_EPIC\mods

6. You can run each .iss file from ISTool or you can setup a version of GNU Make and use the supplied make file (after tweaking any paths as needed). I use make under cygwin which seems to work well
