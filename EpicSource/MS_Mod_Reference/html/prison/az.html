An eAMP of Epitaph

<BODY>
<p>The 'Base' ships for the converted edrones of Epitaph.  The eAMP's not only house, repair and refuel the edrones, but they also contain automated factories, capable of processing and converting ores.  Potentially these automated factories could also be building more edrones.  Only a concerted effort by one of the more powerful factions might be able to eliminate the threat that the eAMP and eDrones may represent.
