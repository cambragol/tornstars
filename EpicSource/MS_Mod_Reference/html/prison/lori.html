mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> Li Po was to have become the second jewel in Emperor
Leung's crown. The planet Chenyuang, though not truly Earthlike, had a
remarkably similar biosphere, and could become another agricultural center if
terra-forming efforts succeeded. Unfortunately, the war destroyed the bio-bomber
being built at the time. Since then, the Emperor's priorities have been
military strength, materials sciences, and biogenetic research, so no efforts to
terraform Chenyuang have resumed. Although the domed colonies on the surface of
Chenyuang are viable, and have begun to produce much-needed crops, the system
still relies on the Gibbs agricultural orbital to feed the Empire. The regional
governor would dearly like to change this, and it is rumored that he is plotting
to sabotage the agricultural orbital to force the Emperor's hand. He would
like to and see his system gain power and status to something greater than its
current role as a fortified border defense state. </span></p>
