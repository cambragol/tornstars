<p>Converted from standard mining drones during the last ditch defence of the system prior to the epic battle of Omayyad.  These relentless machines continue to haunt the Epitaph system, 'converting' any craft that penetrate the system into their constituant matter.  Based out of the larger eAMP's the edrones are possibly continuing to manufacture themselves unhidered by any human restrictions.
