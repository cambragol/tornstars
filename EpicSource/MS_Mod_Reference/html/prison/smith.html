mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> Emerald is the only true garden world in this entire
cluster, and as such is critically important to the entire region. Having
already suffered disaster at the hands of the Sultan Malik Shah almost one
hundred years ago, the people of Emerald are unlikely to allow such an
abominable act to occur again. After rebuilding their cities and spaceports from
the destruction wrought by the war, they have maintained a fierce sense of
independence and protectiveness toward their world. The Capital city of </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:

continues to grow, but has been beautifully designed and rebuilt. It also boasts
a new University (An-Chi University) and is a point of interest for many
tourists and culture seekers. Emerald has also just recently completed
construction of a new beanstalk, making orbital transport even more economical.
The government is the closest thing to a democracy in this cluster, and has
developed a good reputation under Prime Speaker Holsworth. Food production and
water supply have been the bulwarks of Emerald's economy, but they are eager
to foster other industries and develop other resources in order to complete the
vision of pure independence and strength. Mining operations are popping up in
this system, as are processing facilities, gas mining refineries, and
manufacturing stations are all either under construction or in the contractor
bidding phase. Ultimately Emerald is aware of the threat they pose to
neighboring powers, if they succeed in their quest for independence and
defensive strength, so they must constantly try to trade with others while
building fleet strength, and enticing Dead Reaches systems or even Barrens
systems to join their cause. <b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>
