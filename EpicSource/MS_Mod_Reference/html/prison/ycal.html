mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">This system is the capital, and the seat of power of
the Sultanate. The first Sultan (Malik Shah) chose this system for its mineral
wealth, its proximity to Al Wadi. It also seemed a good choice for the Mars-like
world of New Constantinople, which was relatively friendly to colonization and
amenable to terraforming once the biobombers could be built. Plans to terraform
it were drawn up, but have yet to get started. The capital city and the Sultan's
palace are under protective domes, which were fortified, and are now heavily
defended due to the military buildup by the second Sultan Abu Tammam. From here,
the new Sultan Salazar and his sister manage the remnants of the Sultanate by
using the vast riches their family has accumulated, and a notorious spy network.
Numerous stations and processing facilities can be found in this system, as well
as the Sultan’s main shipyard. This is one of the few systems in the Middle
States Cluster that has a vast library and a vibrant, reputable university: The
University of Tulun. </span>
