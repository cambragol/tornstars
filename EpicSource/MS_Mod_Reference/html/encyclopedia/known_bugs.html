<b>Known Bug List</b>
<hr>

<P>Unstable Space is a mod. 
There were several major issues that we could not resolve without source code.

<P>
<b>
Broken Menu
</b>
<P>Symptom: You try to open the Ship Computer menu and you only get beeps. 
Nothing opens. You dock to a station and the menu does not open.
<P>This problem is a bug in the EoC code. 
When a player tries to change the game options while flying in space 
(Changing the sound volume for example) the game stops being able
to read the INI control files. The game is broken at that point and the
mod cannot continue. No error message is displayed. The 
<P>The beeping is caused by the menu code not being able to open 
the INI files that it must read to operate.

<b>
Lost Wingmen
</b>
<P>Symptom: Your wingmen are following you when you jump, but they never show up.
<P>Wingmen sometimes lose track of your ship in jump. Or they jump to the wrong Lpoint. 
<P>The first step is always make sure your wingmen were given orders to formate with 
your ship before you jump. Make sure they are close when you do jump.
<P>If they jumped to the wrong location or failed to jump, they will return to you shortly.
Just wait a few moments for them to appear. 


<P>
<b>
No Autopilot
</b>
<P>Symptom: You try to use the autopilot to reach a station in another system and it will
not work. 
<P>We did this on purpose. 
There is a bug in the autopilot code that jumps the player to the wrong lpoint.
The only way to fix the bug is to not allow autopilots to perform capsule jumps. 
Your going to have to rely on your own navigation skills. 
Start reading the star map!
