<b>Non Player Ships</b>

<hr>

<P>
There are many helpful vessels populating the Middle States. 
These ships can buy or sell items that you need. 
They start a cyan color on your contact list. 
To start trading or hire use the ship to ship communication system. 
<br><a href="keybinds.html">Keybinds</a><br>
<P>
The Navigation Screen has helpful filters that will allow you to find ships for hire.

<b>
Science Ships
</b>

<P>
Science ships carry specialized scanning equipment for long range location of asteroids.
Hire these wingmen to scan new star systems for unclaimed asteroids. 
The scanning range is different for each type of science ship and is listed in the
Wingman Status screen.
<br>
Science ships also carry subsurface sensing equipment and teams of geologists. 
These ships can survey a newly discovered asteroid and search for valuable ore deposits.
After docking to the asteroid, they begin the survey. After a few days, they send an email
describing the mineral wealth. 
<br>
Some science ships are better at scanning than prospecting. 
You can evaluate your science ship features in the Wingman Status screen.
<br>
See <br><a href="mining.html">Mining</a><br> for a discussion 
of using science ships and mining rigs.



<P>
<b>
Mining Rigs
</b>

<P>
Mining Rigs can be used to mine your claimed asteroids. 
These drilling rig type ships often do not have LDS or Capsule Drives. 
You will need to tow them to the asteroid.
Some models are more efficient than others at recovering ore. Check the Wingman Status
screen for details on the ship you have hired.
<br>


<P>
<b>
Fuel Tanker Wingmen
</b>
<P>
You can hire high capacity fuel tanker wingmen to supply your trade or 
mining fleet as they travel across the cluster. These tankers are 
essential for keeping mining rigs supplied, since they never leave their 
asteroids. 
<P>
These fuel tanker wingmen do not magically create fuel, but they have very 
large tanks and can supply many ships before needing to fuel back up. They 
refuel from Fuel Sellers just like all other wingmen.

<P>
<b>
Fuel Sellers
</b>

<P>
You can purchase fuel from the many fuel tankers you can find near most 
stations. These fuel tankers show up as a cyan color on your contact list.
<P>Use the ship to ship communication system to start a dialog and 
purchase fuel for your ship or fleet of wingmen.


<P>
<b>
Trade Ships
</b>

<P>
You can purchase new equipment and weapons for your ship from Traders and Black Market Traders. 
These traders fly ships near stations and start a cyan color on your contact list. 
<P>Use the ship to ship communication system to start a dialog. 
If they like you, they will let you purchase equipment.
<P>Trade ships can be found near shipyards, mercenary bases, navy bases or police stations.
<P>Black market traders can be found near pirate stations.



<P>
<b>
Cargo Fence
</b>

<P>
You cannot sell stolen cargo to a legal station. 
They will refuse to purchase the cargo. 
Instead you need to find one a cargo fence that works for one of the criminal factions.
<P>
These cargo fences are found near legal mining, processing, or manufacturing stations. 
They stay just outside of patrol range. 
The Navigation Screen will remember the fences you have seen. 
Use the "Fence" filter to locate the fences. 
<P>
The cargo fences will purchase illegal cargo for a fraction of the standard price.


<P>
<b>
Pod Scrappers
</b>

<P>
Pod scrappers will give you a low flat price for any cargo pod you bring them. 
They are very useful to pirates who cannot find someone to fence the cargo they have looted.
Legal traders may just want to get rid of cargo pods if they cannot find a buyer.
<P>
Pod scrappers live near shipyards and pirate stations.


<P>
<b>
Rumor Sellers
</b>

<P>
Rumor sellers will sell you the location of hidden Pirate Bases and Fences within the current system.
<P>
You can find rumor sellers near any Casino, Entertainment, or Habitat station.


<P>
<b>
War Ships
</b>
<P>
There are mercenary war ships for hire if you have the funds and a high faction standing.
They range in size from Tugs to Corvettes.
<P>
War ships can be found at mercenary and pirate bases.


<P>
<b>
Transport Ships
</b>
<P>
There are mercenary transport ships for hire for hauling trade cargo and pirate loot. 
They range in size from 6 pod SNRV ships to 20 pod Venice class freighters.
<P>
Transport ships are found near waystations and shipyards.
