<b>Trade Guild Notes</b>
<hr>

<P>
It is the duty of the Trade Guild to assist the rebuilding of the Middle States
with efficient cargo delivery. These notes are provided to our members to help
them ply their trade in a safe a profitable manner.


<P>
<b>Moving Cargo</b>
<BR>
Trade ships earn a profit hauling cargo pods from producer stations to consumer stations.
The Middle States is a hard place to earn a living. 
Profits are low and costs are high.
<P>
It is important to understand how stations relate and how prices are calculated. 
These items are discussed here in <a href="economy.html">Economics.</a><BR>
<P>
It is suggested Captains investigate Danger Pay bonuses and finding short cut routes.

<P>
<b>Hiring Wingmen</b>
<BR>

<P>
If you do find profitable trade routes you will soon find that you need to 
move and protect large numbers of cargo pods. To handle the volume you will
need to hire wingmen.
<P>
Excellent members of the Trade Guild are available at most Shipyards and 
waystations for reasonable rates. 
Pay and Upkeep are discussed here in <a href="wingmen.html">Wingmen.</a>


<P>
<b>Fuel and Fees</b>
<BR>
<P>All star ships burn fuel and require constant upkeep. 
Always keep an fund to pay for fuel. 
This is especially important on long trade routes where it might be
many days before you are paid for your cargo. 
<P>
Guild traders are legally allowed to leave the service of Captains that
cannot pay wages and upkeep. Budget carefully.


<P>
<b>Lagrange points</b>
<BR>
Lpoints are common places to encounter police patrols and pirates looking to charge
extortion fees. 
Plan your routes carefully. 
Routes are so dangerous that Guild ships are prohibited from Autopilot navigation.
<P>
Full details on police and pirates can be found here in 
<a href="patrols.html">Patrols</a><BR>


<P>
<b>Building Trade Routes</b>
<BR>
A merchant builds trade routes by building Reputation and Standing. 
As you increase in standing, companies will sell you the goods you need to maximize your profits.
A single pod of high value nano tech can earn more than a ship full of ore. 
But without the reputation you will never be able to purchase it. 
Learn more about increasing your standing here in 
<a href="reputation.html">Reputation.</a><BR>
<P>
Examine the stations that are near you. 
Learn what they need. 
Form two way or three way circular trade routes.
<P>
Invest your profits into reputation. 
Purchase more valuable trade goods and increase your profits on each trip.
<P>
Once you have enough credits saved, hire some larger freighters. 
Those larger ships burn fuel faster, but are more efficient for large numbers of cargo pods.



<P>
<b>Professional Assistance</b>
<BR>
Many other merchants exist to assist a Captain. 
Some of these are legal merchants and others are less so.
