<P>
The Middle States has more than 500 stations building and using a huge number of 
cargo pods every day. Traders who master the ebbs and flows of cargo and
cargo pricing can thrive. Those who wander blind will soon find they 
have no credits and no fuel.

<P>
<b>
Cargo Pods
</b>

<P>
Trade is done by purchasing cargo pods from stations. 
These pods are transported to consumer stations for sale.
The price difference between purchase and sale is the profit that a trader earns.
<P>
Cargo pods are moved by trade ships hired for the purpose. 
They range from small utility vessels to large 20 pod freighters.

<P>
<b>
Trade Screens
</b>

<P>
You can purchase and sell cargo only when a transport wingman has docked to the cargo spewer of a station. Upon docking, the Cargo Purchase or Cargo Sell GUI can be opened to either buy or sell pods. Only pods that the faction is willing to sell to you will be available on the Cargo Sell screen. Choose the cargo to be bought or sold then press the Purchase Order or Sell Offer buttons. Thereafter the transport ship will begin loading or unloading cargo pods from the Pod Spewer. A counter of pods remaining to be loaded or unloaded will count down. When the loading or unloading is finished, undock your transport ship and the transaction is complete. 
<P>
You can see all cargo produced at a station in the Buy screen. 
You can see the cargo a station needs in the sell screen even if you have none to sell.
This information is vital to profitable route planning.


<P>
<b>
Prices
</b>

<P>
Surplus production drives the price of cargo down. 
The star system with the highest surplus of a type of cargo will have the lowest price.
A wise trader will locate these systems.
<P>
Trade ships carry this surplus to other systems that need the cargo.
Each system distant from the surplus increase the price paid. 
<P>
A trader must be careful not to purchase cargo far from a surplus and haul the cargo
toward the surplus. This will result in dropping prices and lost profits.
<P>
Careful records of the prices in each system will allow finding the system with the
largest surplus and lowest prices. 


<P>
<b>
Reputation and Standing
</b>

<P>
Companies prefer to deal with merchants they know and trust. 
They will not sell you the best cargo if they do not like you. 
And they will not sell you any cargo if they think you are a pirate.
<P>
Use the Reputation GUI to upgrade your standing with the companies you need to trade.


<P>
<b>
Short Cuts and Danger Pay
</b>

<P>
Cargo prices are set by the cost of moving the cargo. 
Insured freight companies take the safest possible route between two points.
If you can discover a short cut through unsafe territory (and you survive the pirates)
you can boost your profits. 
<P>
The best profits are often made shipping from a safe government zone into an unsafe system.
<P>
Danger pay is built into the pricing of all trade routes that must pass through
unpatrolled space. This danger pay is to encourage traders to haul the cargo
and to pay for escort war ships. 
You can earn bonus profits by operating in hostile systems.
There is a danger you will lose your ship in combat.
<P>


<P>
<b>
Customs Patrols and Pirates
</b>

<P>
Governments charge taxes on all cargo that crosses the border. 
They do this to pay for Navy patrols and pirate removal. 
These taxes can be very high. 
It can be worth finding smuggling routes around the customs patrols.
<P>
Pirates make a rich living by taxing merchant ships that pass through lpoints they control.
These pirates will not attack if they are paid promptly. 
These "toll" fees can be expensive, but less expensive than losing a ship or cargo.



<P>
<b>
Station Inventory
</b>

<P>
Stations hold only a limited number of each type of cargo pod. 
As the pods are purchased the inventory declines. 
When the inventory is empty, no more pods can be purchased. 

<P>
The inventory will grow back as the station produces more goods. 
This growth is very slow. It can be as little as 1 pod every other day or every week.
<P>
A trader may need to work several different trade routes while stations rebuild inventory
levels. A large trade fleet can empty a station of cargo in a single run.
<P>
A station is willing to purchase any amount of goods that you wish to sell.
These goods are either stored or shipped to other stations.
Sold goods are not available for repurchase.

<P>
<b>
Mining, Processing, Manufacturing
</b>

<P>
Mining stations produce raw ores and sell those ores to Processing stations. 
Mining stations require manufactured equipment to perform the mining task (robots and drills).
<P>
Processing stations purchase raw ore and turn it into processed goods. 
The processed goods are sold to manufacturing stations.
<P>
Manufacturing stations use processed goods to create a wide variety of manufactured items.
These items are sold to many kinds of stations.
<P>
When docked at a station you can use the trade screens to learn what kinds of cargo that 
station needs and which kinds of cargo the station produces.
<P>
You will need to study these cargo carefully to design profitable trade routes.


<P>
<b>
Illegal Cargo Pods
</b>
<P>
Illegal cargo pods are those that are stolen or pirated from other ships. 
Once stolen, the cargo pod controls are hacked and the cargo pod will change to the pirates faction.
<P>
All cargo pods maintain a memory of the legal cargo pod owner. 
This owner can be seen when the cargo pod is targeted. 
It is shown as the "shipping agent" along the bottom of the target data window.
<P>
Stations check the legal owner and will refuse to purchase stolen cargo pods.
<P>
Embezzling operations purchase stolen cargo and launder it in with the legal station goods.
These Embezzling operations have Fences that operate on the edge of the station space.


<P>
<b>
Losing Cargo Pods
</b>

<P>
It is recommended that cargo pods be kept docked to your wingmen at all times. 
The Middle States is a dangerous place full of desperate people. 
Cargo pods left out of sight tend to vanish without a trace. 
The only safe cargo pods are those docked to your ships. 

(Save games will not preserve undocked cargo more than 200km away from the player ship).
