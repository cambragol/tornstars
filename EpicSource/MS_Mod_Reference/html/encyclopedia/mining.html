<b>Mining Career</b>
<hr>

<P>
The mining career is capital and equipment intensive, but very profitable. 
The best unclaimed mines are found in unexplored systems.


<P>
<b>Mining Overview</b>
<br>
Mining starts by finding an asteroid that is unclaimed. Unclaimed 
asteroids will have an "Empty" faction marker. This indicates that no one 
has claimed them. The best asteroids are found in border systems, or in 
the uncharted systems
<br>
Science ships are equipped with long range scanners that can spot 
unclaimed asteroids at ranges of 500,000km or more. 
<p>
Once you have found an unclaimed asteroid, you need to survey it to claim 
it. This requires a prospecting ship. Most science ships also support 
prospecting. You give the order to prospect an unclaimed asteroid, and the 
science ship will dock and begin the survey. 
<br>It takes several days to survey, and there is a large fee per day. 
When the survey is complete, the asteroid is yours (claimed). 

<p> 
After surveying and claiming an asteroid, you can hire mining rigs to 
begin harvesting the ore. Mining rigs are towed into position and latch 
onto your claimed asteroid to begin producing ore. 
<br>
Cargo pods of ore are produced and will be waiting for you to haul to sale 
at a processing plant.



<P>
<b>Unclaimed Asteroids</b>
<BR>
<P>
In the charted systems (those you can see on in the starting navigation 
screen) all the asteroids have been located. Not all are claimed by 
corporations or independents. These left over asteroids tend to have low 
richness values, but they are easy to find. 
<br>
Check the navigation screen. If you cannot see the owning faction of a 
mine, fly to that mine to check it out. If you see the mine is owned by 
"Empty" then it is unclaimed and you can try to claim it with a 
hired prospecting ship.
<br>
The best asteroids are in the uncharted systems. These asteroids must be 
located using hired science ships with deep system scanners. 



<P>
<b>Scanning</b>
<BR>

<P>
These science ships can help you find the most valuable asteroids. Science ships are 
availiable for hire at HQ and Research stations. Larger ships typically 
have longer ranges. 
<br> 
Science ships are given scan orders from the "mining" wingman command 
menu. They scan all space in scan range and report if they find any new 
contacts. You can view the new contacts in the Navigation screen.
<br>
When you first enter an uncharted system, there will be no contacts in the 
Navigation Screen. Use the "Planets" filter to reveal the systems planets 
and begin sweeping around those for mines. Eventually you will begin to 
learn where the belts might be located and scan those.



<P>
<b>Prospecting</b>
<BR>
<P>
After you find an unclaimed asteroid, you must prospect it to evaluate the 
ore potential and claim it for your own. Hired prospectors can do the 
subsurface survey work. Most science ships have both scanning and 
prospecting abilities.
<p>
Escort a prospecting ship to an unclaimed asteroid. Using the wingman 
command keys (mining menu) order it to start prospecting. The wingman will 
dock to the asteroid and start the survey. It normally takes several days 
for a survey to complete. An email will be sent with the results.
<p>
Once the survey is complete, the asteroid will be claimed and will change 
to your faction. Your free to move the prospecting ship to a new asteroid 
for more survey work.

<P>
<b>Mining Rig Operation</b>
<BR>

<P>
Mining Rigs are used to draw out the ore from your newly claimed mine. 
Rigs can be hired near most processing stations. Mining rigs typically 
have no LDS or Capsule drive and must be towed into position. 
<br>
Once they are near the claimed asteroid they can be ordered to begin 
mining. They will latch onto the asteroid and start producing ore.
<br>
The mining rig charges a fee to operate (equipment expenses) and uses fuel 
as a normal ship. It must be kept supplied with fuel, typically by hired 
tanker.

<P>
<b>Mining Economics</b>
<BR>
There are many upfront costs to mining. It is easy to spend a fortune on 
hire fees and fuel and then have a run of poor quality claims. Everyone 
dreams of that lucky strike on a rich bit of Neutronium that will set them 
up as the new Sultan.
<P>
A science ship is the first thing that is needed. It will charge a hire 
fee, upkeep fees, and a high fee for survey work. If you don't have enough 
money, it will quit.
<P>
Mining rigs have a hire fee, charge upkeep, and use fuel. Plus they charge 
an extra upkeep fee while drilling ore. They produce pods of ore. The 
number is the asteroid Richness * Efficiency of the mining rig. You will 
want to run the profit calculations carefully, it is easy to end up 
spending more mining than you get from a poor quality mine.
<P>
Fuel is a critical supply when mining. Trade ships in the core systems 
take for granted the ready supply of tankers willing to sell fuel. In the 
uncharted systems there are no stations and miners will need to hire 
wingman tankers to keep them supplied. 
<br> Watch your fuel guages carefully. You would not be the first group of 
miners to find yourselves floating without power in the vast nothingness 
for lack of a little basic math.
