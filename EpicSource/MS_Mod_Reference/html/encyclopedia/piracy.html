<b>Anarchists Guide to Piracy</b>
<P>
Do you like danger and excitement? 
No respect for personal property laws?
We have just the job for you! Piracy!
<P>
Shooting up corporate shipping is not all fun and games. 
These sheep have started to shoot back!


<P>
<b>Wingmen</b>
<P>
You will need wingmen to help you liberate and carry your loot home.
Freighters and war ships can be hired through out the cluster. 
They do insist on getting a cut however. More details are 
<a href="wingmen.html">here.</a><BR>


<P>
<b>Gathering Loot</b>
<P>
You can gain control of liberated cargo by Hacking the pod control 
computer. Use your hacking tools by pressing "j" on the keyboard.
The ships computer will find nearby pods that can be hijacked, 
and will take control of them. The owing faction will change to your
faction and you can load the pods normally.
<P>More information on keyboard commands <a href="keybinds.html">here.</a><BR>


<P>
<b>Piracy and Relations</b>
<BR>
Once you attack a faction, they take a record of your ship, and its sensor 
signature. If you attack them often enough, they will become hostile and anytime 
they see you in the future, they will attack on sight. 

Once they have become hostile there is nothing you can do or say to 
convince them you have become an honest citizen again. 
<P>
You can read more about standing in <a href="reputation.html">Reputation.</a><BR>

<P>
After a long life of making enemies, you might want to retire in peace. 
You can erase your identity. This service is done at pirate bases. It 
is very expensive. Not only will it erase your negative relations, it will 
also erase all your positive relations. You essentially start life over, 
but with all your stolen cash.
<P>Dock to the Pirate Base and use the Ship Computer menu to select this option.


<P> <b>Governments</b> <BR>
Governments take the job of protecting the citizens seriously. Too 
seriously. Any attack on civilian or government shipping will result in 
the issuing an attack on sight order to all government vessels. 
<P>
The best places to pirate are the star systems that are not claimed by any 
government. In these systems you can attack shipping without any 
government caring one way or another.
<P> 
It is a matter of time before a pirate finally makes an enemy of the 
government. But choose carefully. It is always nice to keep at least one 
government faction friendly. You never know when you might need to flee 
into the protective arms of a Navy Defense Station.
<P> 


 <P>
<b>Other Pirates</b>
<BR>
Governments will not go hostile if you attack pirates. They consider 
you are doing a public service and will turn a blind eye to your 
activities. This makes preying on your fellow criminals tempting, but you 
need to consider the long term costs. The other pirates operate the fences 
you need to sell cargo, the black markets you need to purchase weapons. If 
you make enemies of them all, you will not be able to earn a living as a 
pirate.

 <P>
<b>L Points</b>
<BR>
Lpoints would seem like natural places to earn a quick credit and they are.
But they are also packed with competition. Armed competition. 
And the government has a bad habit of patrolling Lpoints also. 
We have just the information to help you dodge these dangers 
<a href="patrols.html">Here.</a><BR>


<P> <b>Fencing Cargo</b> <BR>
Legal stations will not purchase stolen cargo pods. Instead, pirated goods 
must be sold to Fences. Fences are found near production stations (mining, 
processing, manufacturing) when pirates have made an embezzling deal with 
station personnel. 
<P>
Fences hang out at a far distance from the station, 
avoiding official attention. They are transports marked with pale blue. Fly 
up to the fence and start communications. You must not be hostile to the 
fence faction to sell goods.
<P>
A Fence purchases the goods that are easiest to launder through the 
nearby station.
<BR>
Fences near Mining Stations will purchase 
any kind of
ore.<BR>
Fences near Processing Stations will purchase any kind of refined 
goods.<BR> 
Fences near Manufacturing Stations will purchase any kind of 
manufacture good.<BR>

<P>
<b>Black Markets</b>
<BR>
Many of the best weapons and equipment are sold by Government and Navy 
stations. This makes life hard on the pirate, but where there is a will, 
there is a way. Black Markets are found near pirate bases.
Where pirates have found corrupt officials to source weapons. 
Black Markets make restricted weapons available, but the price can be 
high.
 <P>
 Black Market ships hang out on the fringe of station space, out of easy 
sensor distance. Fly up to the Black Market ship and start communications 
to purchase otherwise restricted weapons. You need good faction relations 
with the Black Market operators to be able to purchase weapons.

<P>
<b>Cargo Scrappers</b>
<BR>
Cargo scrappers junk cargo pods, legal or illegal. They are handy for 
pirates who are caught without a fence. You can find pod scrappers around 
any ship yard or pirate base. The pay is poor, a small flat fee for each 
pod. Find a Fence if you can. But in a pinch, Cargo Scrappers can mean the 
difference between fuel and no fuel.


<P>
<b>Other Assistance</b>
<P>
There are other ships that can assist you with equipment or services. 
They are described here <a href="non_player.html">Services.</a><BR>
