<b>Capsule Jumping</b>
<hr>

<P>
System to System jumps are totally different in Torn Stars: Unstable 
Space. This section describes how to make jumps and explore the uncharted 
jumps and star systems in the game.

<P>
<b>Jumping Overview</b>
<p>
<br>
Capsule jumping is done by flying to within 200km of an Lpoint and then 
pressing the "Tab" key to speak with the Navigation officer. The Nav 
officer will give you a set of possible jump destinations. Once you select 
a destination, the Lpoint will begin to flash, and the destination will 
appear in the lower left of the HUD.
<p>
You then fly to within 3km of the Lpoint, keeping your speed around 1000m/s, and your ship will commence the 
transfer to capsule space. It is recommended (and safer!) that you approach the Lpoint 
from the blue entry side, but it is not a requirement of capsule space 
physics that you do so.
<p> 
Your capsule drive will open what appears to be a tunnel linking your 
start Lpoint and destination Lpoint. You must steer your ship's capsule bubble 
down this tunnel before the injected energy fades and your bubble 
collapses. A timer displayes the estimated time to collapse.
<p>
Do not strike the walls of the tunnel or any of the energy anomolies 
(lights) that appear. These will collapse your capsule bubble and break 
your link to the destination Lpoint. If your bubble collapses before 
reaching the destination, you will be tossed back out into normal space, most likely near the starting 
location. The energy of the capsule jump will be emitted with you, often 
causing damage to your ship.  Unstable capsule tunnels, with larger energy fluctuations, will inherently cause more damage when the capsule bubble collapses pre-maturely.



<P>
<b>Route Stability</b>
<BR>
<P>
Commercial shipping only uses Stable capsule jump routes. These are low 
energy routes that are very easy to navigate. All but the least competent 
pilots can cross these routes.
<br>
There are many levels of unstable routes: Weak, Unstable, Dangerous, 
Deadly. These routes will cause damage to ships using standard commercial 
capsule drives.
<br>
The military has developed very high energy drives for exploration and 
scouting. These drives can allow ships to survive crossing Dangerous and 
Deadly level routes. The drives are very expensive and hard to find.



<P>
<b>Sensing Unstable Routes</b>
<BR>
<P>
Unstable jump routes are hard to detect. Standard commercial active 
sensors cannot collect enough information for a reliable jump calculation. 
Higher level active sensors will allow you to 'see' unstable routes. The 
very best active sensors can even detect the faint traces of a Deadly 
route. But no one should take such a route, even if they can see it.
<br> 
Unstable routes have unknown destinations. You must travel the route to 
see where it leads. This is how you explore for new systems.
<br>



<P>
<b>Finding Uncharted Lpoints and Systems</b>
<BR>
<P>
Unstable routes are not charted on normal navigational charts. Lpoints 
that have no stable routes will not be charted. You will need to visit 
these Lpoints and scan for possible routes.<br>
Use the Lpoint Finder option in the ship menu. This screen will display a 
selection of local moons. Each moon will host a primary, some of which may have potential capsule routes. Lpoint. Select the 
moon to drop a waypoint at the location. Then visit the Lpoint to scan it 
for potential routes.
<br>
These uncharted Lpoints may lead to a new system. Or they might give you a 
backdoor smuggler route into a charted system.
