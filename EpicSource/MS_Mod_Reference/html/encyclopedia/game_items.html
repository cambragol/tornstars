Save Anywhere
</b>

<P>
Unstable Space allows you to save when you are anywhere in space. 
<P>
When there are no hostile ships nearby you can open the 'Comp Net' menu, where you will find a Save Game button. 
Press this button to open a save game menu and select a save game slot. 
Your game will be saved at this point. 
<P>
You can load this save game from the Start Screen of the game. 
When the game loads, your ship will be returned to this save location. 
Any wingmen you have will be placed where they were at the moment you saved.

<P>
<b>
Save Anywhere Limitations
</b>
<P>
EoC was not designed with a save anywhere feature. 
The information that is saved is very limited. 
It saves the player ship and player wingmen. 
But it does not save ship damage or subsystem damage. 
Those return to healed when the game is restored. 
This opens a possible exploit for player. 
You will have to choose to use this feature for convenience, or exploit it for healing. 
It is your game, after all.
<P>
The game does not save current traffic or station damage. 
If you are chasing some pirates back to their base, do not save! 
They will not exist when you restart. 
Instead, finish your chase and only save when the combat is resolved. 
<P>
This feature can be a blessing if you use it to save just before you plan to go into combat.
It is also good for saving while making long trade journeys that you do not wish to repeat.

<b>
Ship to Ship Communications
</b>
<P>
Unstable Space supports direct ship to ship communication with some Nonplayer ships and most stations. 
The ships which can be communicated with are typically mercenaries, traders, miners, tankers or science ships for hire or ships selling illegal goods and services.
<P>
Most of these ships are marked on your contact list with a pale blue color. 
More illegal ships tend to hide, waiting for contact. 
Target a possible ship and press "v" to start communications. 
If the ship is open to contact, a dialog will appear.
If contacting a station, you may request docking clearence 
Follow the dialog prompts to purchase goods and services, or request specific dock ports.


<P>
<b>
Time and Travel
</b>
<P>
Unstable Space keeps track of the passage of time. 
Your ships are billed upkeep based on this time passage. 
Stations also refill inventory based on the passage of time.
<P>
The major time shift is caused by capsule jumping.  Capsule jumping, although taking only seconds for the player, takes up many hours in normal space.
Each system to system capsule jump takes typically one full day to complete.
<P>Every four hours of in game flight time is also counted as one full day.
