Commanding Wingmen
</b>
<hr>

<P>
The command interface is very efficient once learned. 
It allows rapid one handed typing of difficult commands.
The commands do take some practice to learn.

<P>
<b>
Command Groups
</b>

<P>
All player wingmen must belong to a Command Group. 
These groups correspond to number keys 1, 2, 3 to 0. 
Commands apply to a whole group. 
Wingmen can only belong to one group at a time. 
When you first purchase a wingman they will start in group 0.

<P>
You might want to split your ships into different groups. 
For instance, your freighters might be in group 5 and the escorts in
group 1.

<P>
<b>
Commands
</b>

<P>
The same number keys 1 to 0 are also used for giving commands to your groups. 
Here are the commands:

<br>
1.	Halt and Stop.
<br>
2.	Formate with me and Protect me.
<br>
3.	Attack my current target.
<br>
4.	Defend my current target.
<br>
5.	Dock with my current target.
<br>
6.	Approach (fly to) my current target.
<br>
7.	Unused.
<br>
8.	Special combat commands submenu.
<br>
9.	Cargo handling submenu.
<br>
10.	Group handling submenu.


<P>
<b>
Using Commands
</b>

<P>Commands are made of a sequence of key presses. 

<P>
The first keypress selects the group you want to command.
The screen will show a prompt of supported commands just under the target reticule. 

<P>
The second keypress is the command you would like to give. 
Most commands complete at this point, and your wingmen will take action.

<P>
As an example: Pressing 1 selects group 1 and then pressing 2 orders the selected 
group to formate with your ship. 

<P>
Some commands need further menu input (such as cargo and group commands). 
You will be prompted for more input.

<P>
You can cancel a command sequence by pressing the back quote (left of the 1 key). 
Press this key to restart a command sequence. 
Useful to know if you accidentally start an "attack my target" command and really 
wanted a "defend my target" command.

<P>
<b>
Group Submenu
</b>

<P>
The "Group Commands" are special. 
They are used to add and remove ships from a group. 
With group commands, the first key press selects the group you want to operate 
on (instead of the group you will give an order to). 

<P>
For example, to add a wingman to group one, you first target one of your wingmen.
<br>
Then you would press 1 to select "Group one". 
<br>
Then press 0 for "Group commands".
<br>
Then press 0 for the group subcommand "Add ship to group".

<P>
Removing a ship from a group will automatically add the ship to group zero. 
This is because all player wingmen must always belong to a group and
group zero is the default group.

<P>
<b>
Cargo Submenu
</b>

<P>
The cargo commands allow the player to move around large numbers of cargo pods quickly and easily.

<P>
<b>
Dock All
</b>

<P>
If you order a group to collect all player pods, 
they will find all nearby pods that belong to your faction and dock those 
pods to the freighters and utility ships within the group. 
The pods will pilot themselves into docking position. 
This is much faster and easier than trying to move a huge freighter to dock to a tiny pod.
<P>
You could split up your freighters into different groups if you wish to segment your cargo.
<P>
To dock other kinds of ships, use the Dock command to force a docking. 
The Dock command can also be used to force a wingman to dock with cargo 
pods that do not belong to you.

<P>
<b>
Undock All
</b>

<P>
If you order a group to undock all pods, they will drop all pods where they are. 
If you want just one ship to drop pods move it to a separate group. 

<P>
<b>
Dock Pod
</b>

<P>
You can use the Dock Pod command to load just one pod. 
Target the pod, then select the group to load the pod, then cargo commands, then Dock Pod. 
The targeted pod will be loaded onto a freighter with an empty cargo dock.
