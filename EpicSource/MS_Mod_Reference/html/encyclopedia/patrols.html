<b>Patrols</b>

<hr>

<P>
Lpoints form natural choke points on intersteller trade routes. 
This makes them popular with navy patrols and pirates. 
<P>
It is worth learning where these patrols happen and plan your travels carefully if you
do not want to lose all your hard earned credits (or your life!)

<P>
<b>
Guard Patrol
</b>

<P>
Some factions place guard patrols on Lpoints to cut down on piracy and keep out raiders. 
Most nations will have posted guards on all lpoints leading into the nation.
<P>
Guard patrols will attack any hostile factions. Pirates should expect fierce resistance.

<b>
Customs Patrol
</b>

<P>
Customs operates ships for collecting taxes from passing traders. 
These patrols will stop traders and demand a tax based on the value of the cargo.
If you refuse the pay the tax or flee, they will attack. 
<P>
These patrols will attack all hostile factions that try to cross the lpoint. 
Pirates beware.

<P>
<b>
Pirate Toll
</b>

<P>
Pirates also love to collect taxes from passing traders. 
It is much less dangerous than trying to steal the cargo pods.
<P>
The pirates will stop trade ships and demand a fee based the value of the cargo.
If you refuse to pay to try to leave they will attack.
<P>
Pirate tolls only occur outside of government boundaries.
