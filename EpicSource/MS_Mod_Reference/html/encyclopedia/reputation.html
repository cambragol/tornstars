Your actions can increase or decrease your standing with all the factions 
in the game.

<b>
Reputation GUI
</b>

<P>
The Ship Computer Menu holds the Reputation GUI. 
Open this GUI to see your current standing with all the factions that are known to you.
<P>
You can pay to upgrade your standing with any faction. 
Upgrading is done from the Reputation GUI. 
You cannot upgrade a faction that has turned hostile. Pick your enemies with care.

<P>
<b>
Uncovering Hidden Factions
</b>

<P>
You can uncover new factions by docking to stations owned by that faction. 
This is the only way to learn about criminal factions or spies (you must find their hidden bases).

<P>
<b>
Attacking Factions
</b>

<P>
If you fire upon a ship the
ship will turn hostile and your standing with the owning faction will drop.
If you fire upon a factions ships on several occasions the faction will turn hostile.
Once a faction is hostile it cannot be bribed back into friendly relations.

<P>
<b>
Government Factions
</b>

<P>
Some star systems are owned and protected by governments. 
If you attack civilians inside these systems then your standing with 
the government will start to drop toward hostile.
If you attack civilians on several occasions the government will turn hostile. 
<P>
A hostile government is especially dangerous because the governments patrol most Lpoints.
<P>
Governments will not turn hostile if you only attack criminal factions. 
Governments consider hunting pirates as a community service. Be warned however, pirates tend to shoot back.

<P>
<b>
Trade and Reputation
</b>

<P>
Standing is a level of trust. 
As a faction trusts you more they are willing to sell you more dangerous weapons, ships and cargo.
The very best trade goods can only be purchased if you have a high standing with the selling corporation.
If you want to purchase a war ship you must have a high level of standing with a government.
<P>
As you attack a faction your standing will drop. 
The faction will start to refuse to sell you items. 
You can see this in the trade screen as items with a "Denied" next to the name. 
If you see a "Denied" you need to increase your standing with the selling faction.
