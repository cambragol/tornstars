<b>Wingmen</b>

<hr>

<P>
Trade and Piracy are far too dangerous to attempt alone. 
You can hire wingmen to haul trade goods and loot. 
And you can hire warships to help with the fighting and defense.


<P>
<b>
Wingman Status GUI
</b>

<P>
You can see your current list of wingmen in the Wingmen Status GUI in the Ship Computer menu.

<P>
The GUI lists the daily and jump costs of each wingman. 
It also lists your current credit account so that you can budget carefully.


<P>
<b>
Hiring Wingmen
</b>

<P>
There are ships for hire throughout the Middle States. 
These ships are typically marked with a pale blue color. 
Use the ship to ship communication feature to open a dialog with a prospective wingman.
<P>
Trade ships for hire are found near shipyards, waystations, and pirate bases. 
Warships for hire are found near mercenary and pirate bases.
<P>
Larger or more powerful ships will require a higher faction standing or they will refuse to 
work for you.

<P>
You can hire up to 9 wingmen into your fleet. If you try to hire more they will refuse to join.

<P>
<b>
Hiring Fee
</b>

<P>
Every ship has a hiring fee. 
The fee increases with the size and firepower of the ship. 
The hiring fee makes it important to budget carefully. 
Constant hiring and firing of ships can be much more expensive than just paying the ships upkeep.

<P>
<b>
Upkeep Fee
</b>

<P>
Every ship charges a daily upkeep fee for salary, parts, and repairs. 
These fees are taken out of your cash accounts. 
If you cannot pay the upkeep, your wingmen will desert. 
Each type of ship has a cost. 
The larger the ship, the larger the fee. 

<P>
<b>
Jump Fuel
</b>

<P>
Each ship uses fuel when it capsule jumps to a new star system. 
The larger the ship, the more fuel it uses. 
Fuel is billed at 1 credit per unit of fuel used. 
You can see the fuel cost of jumping your ship in the Wingman Status GUI. 
Fuel is refilled automatically every day when upkeep costs are calculated 
(in future releases, you will need to refill the ships yourself). 
If you cannot pay to refuel a ship, it will desert.

<P>
<b>
Desertion
</b>

<P>
If you cannot pay the salary and upkeep your wingmen expect, they will desert. 
They will send a message saying they are leaving. 
They will change faction and no longer take orders. 
They will take any docked cargo with them. 
You will not be charged any more upkeep fees once they desert.

<P>
Desertion can be very expensive in lost cargo.
Be careful to keep a reserve of funds when making long distance trades.

<P>
<b>
Releasing a Wingman
</b>

<P>
You can use the ship to ship communication feature to fire a wingman. 
Typically this is done to reduce costs. 
The wingman will change faction, no longer take orders and leave. 
The player will no longer be charged upkeep for the wingman.
