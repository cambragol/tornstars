<b>Wingmen</b>

<hr>

<P>
Trade and Piracy are far too dangerous to attempt alone. 
And mining is impossible without numerous support ships. You can hire wingmen to haul trade goods and loot. 
You can hire warships to help with the fighting and defense.  You can hire science vessels to help with scanning and analysis.  You can hire mining tugs and prospectors to help in extracting ores. Fuel ships can be hired to refuel and support your various other wingmen. 
<P>
<b>
Fleet GUI
</b>

<P>
You can see your current list of wingmen in the Fleet GUI in the Ship Computer menu.

<P>
The GUI lists the daily upkeep and fuel costs of each wingman. 
It also lists your current credit account so that you can budget carefully. It is very important to manage your ships upkeep and fuel costs, and these will determine how large an operation you can afford, and whether or not you will make a profit in an ventures you undertake. 
<P>
<b>
Hiring Wingmen
</b>

<P>
There are ships for hire throughout the Middle States. 
These ships are typically marked with a pale blue color. 
Use the ship to ship communication feature (Ctrl-C) to open a dialog with a prospective wingman.
<P>
Trade ships for hire are found near shipyards, waystations, and pirate bases. 
Warships for hire are found near mercenary and pirate bases. Mining rigs and Fuel ships can be found near shipyards.  Science vessels are usually stationed at corporate headquarters. Prospectors and small mining ships can often be found squandering their earnings at casinos. Aside from these common locations, there are numerous other places to find wingmen willing to be hired. 
<P>
Larger or more powerful ships will require a higher faction standing or they will refuse to 
work for you.

<P>
You can hire up to 9 wingmen into your fleet. If you try to hire more they will refuse to join.

<P>
<b>
Hiring Fee
</b>

<P>
Every ship has a hiring fee. 
The fee increases with the size and firepower of the ship. 
The hiring fee makes it important to budget carefully. 
Constant hiring and firing of ships can be much more expensive than just paying the ships upkeep.

<P>
<b>
Upkeep Fee
</b>

<P>
Every ship charges a daily upkeep fee for salary, parts, and repairs. 
These fees are taken out of your cash accounts. 
If you cannot pay the upkeep, your wingmen will desert. 
Each type of ship has a cost. 
The larger the ship, the larger the fee. 

<P>
<b> Fuel per Jump </b>

<P>
Each ship uses fuel when it capsule jumps to a new star system. 
The larger the ship, the more fuel it uses. 
You can see the fuel cost of jumping your ship in the Fleet  GUI. Ship's must be refueled or they will stop operating. Refueling ships can be found at shipyards and waystations, among other locations. Some fuel ships can even be hired as wingmen to support long distance trading, or exploration of new systems. In the latter case, a fuel ship is virtually a necessity, unless one wish to be stranded in an unknown, unpopulated system with no possible way home.
<P><b>Fuel per Day </b>

<P> In addition to using fuel for capsule space jumps, any ship will use a certain amount of fuel per day simply keeping the ship in operation. The exact amount used per day can be viewed in the Fleet GUI via the ships Comp Net. 
<P><b>Maximum Fuel</b>

<P> Both daily operation of a ship and capsule jumping will deplete a ship's maximum fuel. A ships remaining fuel will be displayed in the Fleet GUI under &quot;Fuel Remaining&quot;. Once &quot;Fuel Remaining&quot; drops to zero, a ship will cease operating and will be unable to move or capsule jump. Keep a careful watch on your wingmen (and your own) fuel levels!
<P>
<b>
Desertion
</b>

<P>
If you cannot pay the salary and upkeep your wingmen expect, they will desert. 
They will send a message saying they are leaving. 
They will change faction and no longer take orders. 
They will take any docked cargo with them. 
You will not be charged any more upkeep fees once they desert.

<P>
Desertion can be very expensive in lost cargo.
Be careful to keep a reserve of funds when making long distance trades.

<P>
<b>
Releasing a Wingman
</b>

<P>
You can use the ship to ship communication feature to fire a wingman. 
Typically this is done to reduce costs. 
The wingman will change faction, no longer take orders and leave. 
The player will no longer be charged upkeep for the wingman.
