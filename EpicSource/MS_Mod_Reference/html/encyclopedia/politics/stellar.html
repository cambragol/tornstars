Vander, the first moon of a large planet called Roessner in the Providence
system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This enormous hospital
thrived despite problems in the rest of the system after the war. The quality of
medical care delivered there made it the primary health care and medical
training center for this entire region. It is also the base of operations of the
roving hospital ships of the Providence Stellar Paramed. There was originally
only a single Jeep-class freighter converted for hospital functions that
traveled with this name, but there are now several such ships moving throughout
the cluster providing health care and training to the systems lacking such
services (which is most of them at present). These ships travel under excellent
escort, a group of fighters dedicated to this task with fierce loyalty and
devotion (mostly mercenaries and other combat pilots whose lives have been
saved. The escorts are necessary as pirates and religious fanatics have tried to
either hijack these ships for their own medical needs, or to pilfer them for the
pharmaceuticals they carry. Either way, no attacks on these ships have been
successful in recent years. The Jeep-class transports, and their escorts all
bear the bright red cross on a white background, the universal symbol for
medical services for hundreds of years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><o:p>
