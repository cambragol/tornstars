Mesa Corporation is a large manufacturing company in the business of building
big orbital facilities, such as bases, manufacturing outposts, and processing
stations. They have been given a number of incentives to establish their
corporate HQ in the Caliphate of Yezhid, which they've gladly done. There has
been plenty of work for them there, but they are interested in contracts
elsewhere in this cluster as well, as rebuilding seems to be a booming industry.<o:p>
