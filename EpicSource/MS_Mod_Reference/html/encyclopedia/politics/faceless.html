become a label as well as an IFF tag for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a
class of citizenry within the Sultanate and Caliphate.&nbsp; Though outwardly
assuming a legitimate roll as traders, haulers, or miners, it is commonly
assumed that they have a criminal element as well.&nbsp; The 'Faceless' are the
lowest 'caste' within both the Caliphate and Sultanate.&nbsp; Whether this and
the accompanying derision, contempt and bigotry they are on the receiving end of
is the cause of their criminal reputation, or they actually earn this label
through nefarious means, is generally unknown.&nbsp; The truth matters little
for they will still be regarded as the lowest of the low.&nbsp; The label
'Faceless' has a
further meaning, referring to those whom have no honor or courage.&nbsp; Despite
this, they do show honor to one another, and will not hesitate to band together
when attacked.</o:p>
