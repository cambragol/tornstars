Industries have been based in Corliss since before the war. This corporation has
been the primary manufacturing and fuel refining industry that has driven much
of the local economy throughout the past hundred years. Chances are that if
you've stopped and re-fueled your ship at the Corliss exchange (and let's
face it, everyone has), then you've purchased Saffron fuel.<o:p>
