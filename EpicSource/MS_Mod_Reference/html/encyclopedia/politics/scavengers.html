become a label as well as an IFF tag for a diverse group of individuals who
survive by picking through the wreckages of stations and vessels left over by
the War of Dissolution, and the many smaller conflicts that followed it. Despite
this IFF tag, they are still referred to as the Scavengers.&nbsp; They
are less organized than the Junkers, who are business savvy and who maintain an
inventory of used ship parts, available at bargain prices. Scavengers pick
through the wreckage simply to keep operational. They can occasionally become
aggressive, and attack in order to increase their foraging possibilities. There
are some rumour that scavengers have been trading with the Junkers, feeding
parts into their system in trade for other more critical parts.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p>
