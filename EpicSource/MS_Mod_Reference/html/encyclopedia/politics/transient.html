<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b>This is a NavComp IFF designation that came into
common usage when traffic controllers and local militia described any vessels
and their occupants who were unregistered, unaffiliated, and deemed to be
undesirable in that system. Transient is generally used in a pejorative sense,
and most often refers to refugee laden passenger ships, or freighters modified
to carry passengers, most of whom are seeking asylum. Destroying these vessels
is considered to be utterly sacrilegious to anyone native to the Middle States
cluster, or anyone familiar with its tragic history, however, they are often
unwanted, so they are gently escorted to a jump point and encouraged to seek a
home elsewhere, preferably where warm bodies and a cheap labour force is needed.
These refugees refer to themselves as 'The Dispossessed'.<span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p>
