Dragon Mercenary</span></b><hr>
<p><b>Base System:&nbsp; </b>Xu Xuan.&nbsp; Found throughout the Dead Reaches,
Emerald Alliance and Leung Empire.</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Black Dragons are engaged in open
hostilities with Golliger's Privateers.&nbsp; They are held in low regard by
many of the factions of the Dead Reaches and Emerald, but are tolerated for the
time being.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span class="spnmessagetext">Shortly after the War
of Dissolution, infighting was tearing the Middle Kingdom apart. One of Emperor
Leung's most loyal and beloved Admirals, Chi An Kong, was in command of the
fleet responsible for a failed attempt to prevent Providence from seceding from
the Empire. The loss to the Empire was great, and a scapegoat was needed to
appease the Magistrates, and to keep the Empire intact. Kong was charged with
treason, and evidence was fabricated to implicate him. With the framing
complete, the Emperor became enraged and sentenced his former protege to death.
However, Kong still had many allies, and several very loyal officers, and they
assisted him in his escape. Dozens defected and rallied to him, bringing ships
and crews to his group. He could have turned against the Empire, but instead,
true to his spirit, he fought in support of the Empire from outside its reach.
Exiled to the fringes, he could never return to his homeland. The Emperor could
not revoke his sentence, and so he could never pardon the loyal admiral. But
after the rebellions finally stopped, Imperial forces never moved against Kong.
The orders to pursue this group simply never materialized.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="spnmessagetext">Kong formed his loyalists into the Mercenary
company: the Black Dragons (in a sense, mocking the Emperor, who is the only one
allowed the imperial dragon symbol). Kong has long since passed away. But the
Black Dragons operate throughout the Dead Reaches and escort Leung Empire trade
ships en route to Emerald.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="spnmessagetext">It is rumoured that the Black Dragons have quietly
regained the Emperor's confidence, and operate with his support and often
under his directives. They operate with state of the art ships and weaponry, and
do not seem to lack for funds or sensitive information. It is widely known that
they do covert work for the Empire, though no official links can be found
anywhere. Some have even speculated that Kong was head of the Imperial Secret
Service, and the whole framing was his idea to permit him to act for the Emperor
against his enemies without implicating the Empire. Whatever the truth, the
Black Dragons are a powerful and effective mercenary clan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:9.0pt"><span class="spnmessagetext">They
are rarely seen in the open, but can be glimpsed running distant escort for the
most important Imperial caravans. However, they also operate for any shipping
line willing to pay the price. The Black Dragons maintain a commercial presence
to gain access to places they otherwise could not go.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p>
