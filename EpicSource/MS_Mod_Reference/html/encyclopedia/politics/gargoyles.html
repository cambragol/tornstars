<p><b>Base System:&nbsp; </b>Epitaph</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Gargoyles prey upon freighters plying the
Nisami-Watts shipping lanes.&nbsp; They have hostile relations with most of the
major factions and many of the lesser as well.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This is one
of the larger pirate clans that have plagued the Barrens systems and the Nisami-Watts
shipping lanes for decades. Although they are often attacked by mercenaries and
militia determined to make their shipping lanes safer, they seem to have an
endless supply of ships and crews despite their apparent rate of losses. It is
rumoured that they are retrieving vessels from the ship graveyards drifting in
Epitaph, but it is well-known that they have done business with Junkers. Their
crews are often conscripts dragged off their victim vessels, or culled from the
refugee 'Dispossessed' ships roaming the cluster. No one has been able to
locate their base of operations, and many have tried. It is believed that they
operate out of several bases in Epitaph, but little more than that is known.
This clan is responsible for large shipping losses to many of the corporations
and other larger powers in this cluster. A well-organized commander of a large
mercenary fleet just might be able to rid the cluster of this bane once and for
all.<o:p>
