layout-grid-mode:line"><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; </span>This is the largest
starship-manufacturing corporation in Human space. They operate field offices in
each of the three major faction capitals, with licensed distributors virtually
everywhere, to ensure that their products are available to anyone who can afford
them. Their cargo ships are often seen carrying loads of ship components to
their licensed production facilities, under escort. They are popular targets for
those who deal with or operate the un-licensed production facilities in this
cluster, which happen to outnumber the licensed ones by almost three to one.</p>
