layout-grid-mode:line">One of the more successful criminal organizations, the
Pimental family has survived the decades of skirmishes and power struggles
within the pirate clans, and established itself as the de facto administration
of the Penda system. After implementing a punishing tax system-wide, the
Pimentals recently pushed to rebuild the defense fleet, and successfully ousted
some of the worst of the pirate gangs in Penda (and incidentally, former
competitors), leaving those they could control alone. This gave the neighboring
Emerald Alliance the impression of stability and lawfulness they were waiting
for to admit Penda into the Alliance.</span></p>
