<p><b>Base System:</b>&nbsp; No base system; found throughout the Dead Reaches
and its border systems.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b>As a faction, the Junkers refer to a group very
similar to the Junkers of the Badlands: they deal in used ship and station
components. The difference between these folks and scavengers, is that Junkers
are more interested in the sale (what they can get for parts), whereas
scavengers want the parts for their own use and survival. Junkers are slightly
more organized than scavs, as they tend to protect one another from outsiders
(even though they compete and bicker amongst themselves), and they are slightly
(only slightly) more scrupulous, as they can be somewhat trusted during a
business transaction. Junkers are good people to have as contacts, as they'll
know how to get needed blueprints, or where to buy that part you need, but
can't afford to buy from the local licensed dealership. They also often know
how to get you high end military grade weapons systems for your ship that you
are NOT supposed to be able to buy on the open market.<span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p>
