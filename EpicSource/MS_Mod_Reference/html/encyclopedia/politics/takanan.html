<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Sultanate, Caliphate and CMC are all active
targets of raiding by the Takanan</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">What
was once a well-equipped fleet of the fastest military ships soon became a
ragtag band of pirates after the war, resorting to extortion from trade convoys
for 'protection', pressgangs for personnel, and outright piracy in order to
keep their fleet operating. Though none of the current Takanan officers were
living at the time of the War of Dissolution, they continue to see themselves as
the keepers of the ideals of the 14<sup>th</sup> Cruisers of the League of
Independent Stars. They have maintained their enmity of the Sultan and the
Caliphates, striking their convoys wherever possible. They also would like to
see the end of the CMC, a corporation they see as being responsible for their
downfall and exile. Rumor has it that they have rebuilt a station in the system
using remains of the smashed derelicts from one hundred years ago. No one has
successfully located it, though (and lived to tell). </span><o:p>
