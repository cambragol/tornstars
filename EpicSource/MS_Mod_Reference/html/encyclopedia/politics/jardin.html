is a name made famous in the Badlands cluster, but they have been under contract
by Emperor Leung for some time, working on resuming the terraforming of the
planet Chenyuang in the system Li Po. The Sultan would dearly love to see New
Constantinople begin the long planned-for terraforming project as well.
Furthermore, both of these powers will stop at nothing to interfere in the
others' plans. This has put the Jardin Terraforming Corporation in a difficult
position, as both a target and a ward of two of the largest powers of this
cluster, depending on where they find themselves. Protection is something they
need, in order to move their ships and equipment into the desired systems, and
to begin their long-term operations.<o:p>
