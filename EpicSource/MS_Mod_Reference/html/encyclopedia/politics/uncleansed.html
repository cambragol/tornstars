class of citizenry within the Leung Empire.&nbsp; Regarded with contempt by all,
the 'Uncleansed' have been forced to the outskirts of society.&nbsp; They
survive doing the jobs and tasks that others deem low, or some how
unclean.&nbsp; It is also commonly known that many of the 'Uncleansed' turn to
crime in order to survive.&nbsp; Though not organized in the fashion of a true
faction, the 'Uncleansed' will come to each others aid when threatened.</o:p>
