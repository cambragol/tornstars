<p><b>Base System:&nbsp; </b>Lombard</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Aikenites are engaged in low level warfare
with the CMC.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">These
tough settlers follow the teachings of 'Salvage' Sal Aiken, who saw the
value of taking what was broken, discarded or damaged, and making something new
and useful from it. They have re-opened one of the stations in Lombard and
operate it without any support from the Corporations or governments of the
surrounding systems. They roam Lombard and surrounding systems in search of raw
materials, debris, and spare parts to keep their odd-looking, cobbled-together
ships operating. They are tremendously resourceful, and good friends to have if
you ever need a part, or a place to dock to have something fixed. They can make
systems of relatively low grade advance to a higher tech level by tinkering and
through their technical acumen (e.g., LDS 1 can become LDS 2 with their help,
heat sinks can be made two levels better, and power plant output can be
augmented slightly, as well). Their ships are old and rough looking, but are
actually much tougher and dangerous than they look. For the most part, this
group will keep to themselves, and can often be traded with. However, they are
fierce fighters when crossed, and attacking even one of their ships will bring
the entire horde to the defense very quickly. Similarly, if they see you as an
ally, there is a good chance that they'll come to your assistance if you find
yourself in trouble. They have operated neutrally in the Lombard system,
co-existing with the Droznic crime organization without much difficulty.
However, the efforts of the CMC to 'remove' them from Lombard have not only
been unsuccessful, but have resulted in considerable losses to CMC personnel and
materiel in Lombard<o:p>
