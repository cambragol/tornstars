de facto owners, the Doran Asteroid Mining Network. DAMN, also referred to as
The Network, was originally a collection of smaller independent mining
operations that set up mineral extraction operations in the sites abandoned by
the old Imperial Industrial Institute (III). As they continued to pull mineral
riches out of mine sites deemed unprofitable by III, they grew in strength, and
banded together for protection. They employ a large number of independent and
mercenary defenders, but they also receive support from a local crime syndicate
(the Lindevaal family), interested in keeping their leisure station open and
profitable.</span><o:p>
