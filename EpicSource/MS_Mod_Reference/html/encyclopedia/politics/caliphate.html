<p><b>Capitol System:&nbsp; </b>Nureddin</p>

<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Caliphate of Yezhid ever suffers under the attacks of
the Takanan Raiders, and engages them upon sight.&nbsp; Tensions with the
Sultanate are very high as well, and further provocations might trigger a
war.&nbsp; The Caliphate also has low regard for the CMC, whom have failed them
in their efforts against the Takanan Raiders.</p>

layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Nureddin was spared the
destruction of the War of Dissolution, but was gutted shortly afterward by the
treaty reparation costs and exodus of its population. It was abandoned by the
Sultanate in its time of crisis, causing discontent in the population remaining
behind.&nbsp; Though it is off the main trade route, Nureddin is often visited
by trade convoys for re-fueling and re-supply.&nbsp; <span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

layout-grid-mode:line">The Caliphate of Yezhid also includes the Saladdin
system, which was essentially wiped out during the War. It has taken over 70
years to rebuild its stations and industry base to a point where it could be
considered viable again.&nbsp; The Caliphate of Yezhid is primarily focused on
the neighbouring Sultanate, but they are also aware of the importance of their
relationship with the Corliss Conglomerate, despite the distance and Barren
system of Hant separating them.</span></span></p>
