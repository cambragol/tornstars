EN-US">The defense machines are automated mining and manufacturing systems that were used to ambush the Leung Fleet in the War of Dissolution.&nbsp;
The hasty conversion to weapons let them get out of control. No one can approach them to reprogram them. And they keep rebuilding
themselves.&nbsp; The gargoyles seem to have discovered how to coexists. Which gives
them a perfect base to raid from.<o:p>
