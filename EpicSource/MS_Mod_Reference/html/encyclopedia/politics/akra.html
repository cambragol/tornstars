layout-grid-mode:line">The Fist of Akra is a mercenary clan, often seen in the
employ of the Caliphate of Yezhid and the CMC. They have recently resettled the
Akra system in an effort to reclaim it. Their specialty is in anti-piracy
missions, and raids on criminal bases. They have built two fortified bases in
remote asteroid strongholds, and make frequent patrols of Akra in an effort to
discourage piracy. They have been in the employ of almost every faction at some
time in the history of the cluster. However, since the betrayal of the Sultanate
during the War of Dissolution (their home system of Akra was smashed by Sultan
Malik Shah's fleet while they were employed to defend his home in New
Constantinople), they have taken particular pleasure in any missions that harm
the Sultanate.</span><o:p>
