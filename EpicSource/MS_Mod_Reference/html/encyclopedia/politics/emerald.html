<p><b>Provincial Systems:&nbsp; </b>Penda, Huang, Providence</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Sultanate of Khallistan and the Leung Empire
are the primary adversaries of the Emerald Alliance, though currently open
warfare does not exist.&nbsp; The Alliance is also being harassed by a number of
criminal, pirate and raider factions that are mostly based out of the Leung
Empire.</p>

the Middle States. Like the Sultanate, Emerald controls a resource that everyone
in the areas either wants or needs: food and water. Possessing the only true
garden world in the cluster, the Emerald Alliance has managed to restore its
profitable agricultural and biological trade in fairly short order.&nbsp; They
have rebuilt their own mercantile fleet, and are in the process of rebuilding
their naval forces. In the meantime, they have hired mercenaries from the Dead
Reaches to protect them. However, they continue to suffer from raids by pirates,
criminal organizations, and independent raiders, some of whom are sponsored by
the Leung Empire.</span></p>
