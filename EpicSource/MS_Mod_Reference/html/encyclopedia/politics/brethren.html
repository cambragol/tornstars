<p><b>Description:&nbsp;</b><b> </b><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The Brethren of Salvation are one of the groups of oddball religious
fanatics that have found their way to the Middle States Cluster seeking refuge.
They have recently established themselves in the abandoned stations of war torn
Ripon in the last decade. The Brethren are a particularly dangerous and
frightening cult. They alter their physical appearances to take on a 'death's head' look. They burn themselves to remove hair and to tighten
and scar the skin of their heads. They often slice off much of their noses to
reveal skull-like nasal cavities, and they file their exposed teeth to give
themselves the most fear-producing aspect possible. They fly smaller ships, such
as fighters, all of which are brightly painted with skull and death motifs.
Apparently, the Brethren see themselves as the scythe of god, saving souls by
expediting their arrival into the bosom of the lord. They see it as their sacred
duty to bring their ministry of salvation to everyone they encounter by killing
the mortal flesh and freeing the immortal soul. Since their arrival almost
nothing has been heard from the system at all. News simply does not come out. A
recent mining expedition encountered the Brethren, and were wiped out save for a
single tug that managed to jump back to Li Po. They reported that the Brethren
attacked without provocation in the most brutal fashion imaginable, methodically
killing any lifeboats, comsecs, or vac-suited individuals. Except for a few
brave traders who keep them supplied, everyone who encounters them, dies.
Bounties have been offered, but none successfully collected. For the time, they
are confined to Ripon, but there is concern that they will run out of survivors
and risk-takers in that system, and try to bring their twisted salvation to
neighboring systems.<o:p>
