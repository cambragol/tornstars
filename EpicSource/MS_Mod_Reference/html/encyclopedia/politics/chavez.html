<p><b>Corporate Headquarters:&nbsp; </b>Bedalov</p>
<p><b>Operations Systems:</b>&nbsp; Throughout the Nisami-Corliss corridor.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span class="spnmessagetext">Hugo Chavez was raised
in Bedalov, and figured out early in his life that this star system was not
going to get the basic supplies it needed unless someone started running regular
supplies. Forty years later, the Chavez Shipping Company is one of the most
lucrative and well-respected freight companies in the Middle States, and has
been credited with keeping many stations of the Dead Reaches functioning. It
continues to operate steady shipping schedules along established runs as far as
the Caliphate of Yezhid, but operates mostly between Corliss and Huang, the
furthest of the Dead Reaches star systems. They operate all manner of
freighters, but most frequently make use of the efficient Venice-class
freighter. Chavez has recently acquired two mega freighters as part of their bid
to expand contracts into the Sultanate. They travel through several different
jurisdictions with relative ease, making them prime suspects for spying, though
they've never been openly accused, nor caught. They frequently hire armed
independents for escorts, but occasionally they require mercenaries for escort.
Sometimes Chavez Shipping convoys require different mercenary groups to travel
with them through different systems, as certain clans are not welcome in certain
systems.<o:p>
