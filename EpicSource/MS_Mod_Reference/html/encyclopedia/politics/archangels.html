<p><b>Base System:&nbsp; </b>Unknown; somewhere in the Sultanate of Khalilistan.</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Archangels are engaged in open hostilities
with the Gargoyles, but are not well loved by many factions that ply the lanes
between Kronholm and New Constantinople.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">This
organization is well trained and well equipped, operating from a hidden asteroid
base somewhere within the Sultanate of Khalilistan. These wealthy and proud
mercenaries operate under the employ of the Sultan, and are largely responsible
for the defense (and offensive dirty work) of the Sultanate. They have enjoyed
this privileged position for decades, much to the dismay of many other mercenary
clans interested in the contract, and the many enemies they've made over the
years as the Sultan's henchmen.<o:p>
