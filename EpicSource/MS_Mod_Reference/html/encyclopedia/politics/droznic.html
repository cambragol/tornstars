strange things about criminal organizations is that when they enter a region
that is completely lawless and chaotic, they can bring a great deal of order and
stability, if not lawfulness. The Droznic family have brought stability and
prosperity to parts of Lombard by applying ruthless codes to their
ever-expanding criminal interests. They have eliminated any pirates or criminal
elements not willing to be utterly controlled by them, and established a
hierarchy of command with themselves at the top. No one tries to cross them, as
the consequences are dire. The Droznics are feared by everyone, as they are
known for hunting down their enemies for as long as required, then killing them
in most unpleasant ways, often eliminating families, loved ones, and associates
as a way of ensuring that the entire criminal world knows not to try to mess
with them. Large bounties have been placed on the heads of the Droznics and some
of their more vicious lieutenants by the CMC, but no one has collected yet. This
faction use armed tugs, older model fighters and maintain a small fleet of
Dreadnaught-class corvettes, apparently salvaged from Epitaph, to keep their
interests defended.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p>
