layout-grid-mode:line">This family built a very successful crime empire in the
Bumpy's Star system by offering the miners and ship crews of that system all
the more base pleasures they may desire. Sex, gambling, psychoactive
pharmaceuticals and all other forms of leisure activities have been very
profitable. The inevitable other criminal activities such as extortion,
protection, loan-sharking and arms trafficking have also made this family rich
and powerful. Of the criminal organizations in this cluster, this one remains
the most accessible and benign.</span></p>
