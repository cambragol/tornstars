not exist.&nbsp; The Sultanate is in a state of hostilities with a number of
minor pirate factions, based out of Epitaph or the systems of the Sultanate
itself.&nbsp; The Sultanate is also continuing to provoke the Caliphate, and
will likely trigger a war soon.</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b>Four systems make up the Sultanate, including the
centre of power, culture and academia at Tulunid (most commonly referred to
simply as New Constantinople), and the source of the Sultanate's power and
riches, the neutronium-rich system of Al Wadi. The families of power in the
Sultanate can only be described as having fantastic wealth. Made rich long ago
by the neutronium wealth of Al Wadi, and the many industries associated with its
extraction and refinement, the citizenry of the Sultanate have become the
wealthiest in the entire cluster. Those with less wealth would call them
pretentious and arrogant. They import almost all of their labour, and look down
on this workforce, despite the fact that they pay them very well. Trade
agreements, shipping contracts, and industrial relations with the Sultanate are
very difficult to get, and highly desired. As difficult as it is to gain entry
into this world of fantastic wealth and power, thousands compete daily to win a
minor prince's attention, a courtier's whisper into the right nobleman's
ear, or a Caliph's endorsement. Once entry has been gained, the stakes are
high, and the possibilities for wealth and power are nearly endless.
Unfortunately, so are the pitfalls, traps and treacherous betrayals, so that
none have gone higher than allowed by those already in power.</p>
