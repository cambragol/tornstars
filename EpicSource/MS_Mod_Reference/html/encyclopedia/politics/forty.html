<p><b>Base System:&nbsp; </b>Ivory Gardens;&nbsp; They are found throughout the
Sultanate and as far as the Caliphate.</p>
<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Forty Thieves are very hostile towards the
ships of the Caliphate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Description:&nbsp; </b>Once the scourge of the Sultanate, the Forty
Thieves have perhaps bought them selves some breathing room in their home
systems by focusing their predations upon the Caliphate.&nbsp; This has done
nothing to endear them to the people of those systems.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"></o:p>
