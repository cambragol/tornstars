<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>The Sultanate of Khallistan and the Emerald
Alliance are the primary adversaries of the Leung Empire, though currently open
warfare does not exist.&nbsp; The Empire is also hostile to most ships and
factions hailing from the Dead Reaches, and is actively hunting down and
destroying any ships belonging to or associated with Golliger's Privateers.</p>

layout-grid-mode:line"><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; The Leung Empire is what remains of the former Empire of
Chung Kuo, one of the factions that first opened, and colonized many of the
stars in this cluster.&nbsp; After the War of Dissolution, several rebellions,
and a few skirmishes with the remaining forces of their post-war enemies (The
Sultanate, and the Consolidated Mining Company), the Empire was dramatically
reduced in power and size. Emperor Leung has managed to retain control of four
of the original Empire's systems, and kept his industrial and economic machine
going despite the devastating losses of ships during the war.</span></p>
