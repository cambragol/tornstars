<p><b>Political Foes:&nbsp; </b>CMC has very strained relations with the Leung
Empire, but there are no open hostilities.&nbsp; The Corliss Conglomerate should
also be considered a primary rival of the CMC.&nbsp; Currently the CMC is
engaged in low level hostilities with the Droznic crime family and the Takanan
Raiders.</p>

layout-grid-mode:line"><b>Description:</b>&nbsp; The CMC is the largest
remaining single mega-corporation in the cluster, and can be counted on to act
in its best corporate interests regardless of history, alliances, or emotions.
It is one of the oldest corporations in this cluster, having helped open it for
settlement back when they were operating in partnership with Emperor Leung.
Those days are long past, and at present there is no love lost between the CMC
and the Leung Empire.&nbsp; The security service arm of CMC is both a police
force and navy for the Watts system.</span></p>
