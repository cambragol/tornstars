layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The Privateers operate out of
the Dead Reaches system of Bumpy's Star. They began over fifty years ago as a
group of miners tired of being harassed and having their rigs and mining
operations destroyed by Emperor Leung and his operatives. They decided to
organize, arm and begin some of their own harassing and raiding. Captain
Golliger is the son of a miner killed by Leung's forces, and has been
operating as head of the Privateers for the past twenty years (hence the name
they've acquired). Golliger is a truly talented man, gifted with song, popular
with the ladies, hard to out-drink, and as good at guerrilla fighting, as he is
at politics and fundraising. As a result, the Privateers now operate a fleet of
well-equipped armed tugs, Patcoms and Corvettes.</span></p>
