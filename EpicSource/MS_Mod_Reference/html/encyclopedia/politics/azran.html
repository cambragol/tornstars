layout-grid-mode:line">Alcuin remained a small backwater system for some time,
but continued to produce a steady supply of goods to neighboring systems when
they most needed them. The Azran Corporation saw potential in Alcuin, and began
aggressive development there in their respective markets. Then EtCom also saw
the potential, and built relays and facilities there as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both corporations served to complement one another, and the entire
population of the system profited for a time. No central administration could
rise to take the reins in the presence of these two corporate powers, making the
system stuck in a constant state of debate over development issues, which
effectively stalled any shared infrastructure. Bureaucratic fumbling and
corporate bumbling have left Alcuin ungoverned in the Dead Reaches star systems.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US"><o:p>
