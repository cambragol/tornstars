<b>Watts.</b> The CMC intentionally withdrew inward and consolidated its fleet in Watts during the post war years. This move quite probably saved them from the same fate that so many others suffered: complete collapse. The Watts system was reinforced and built up to survive the dark times, with as much self-sufficiency as possible. There are ship production facilities, system defense stations, mining and processing facilities, manufacturing and an agricultural orbital. Though this diversification saved them through the dark times, it is also preventing them from expanding as rapidly as they would like in this new era of rebuilding and reclamation. Trade with the Leung dynasty kept them viable for eighty years, but this trade relationship is rapidly becoming a painful hindrance to their expansion as the two compete with one another. The Empire, and more aggressively the CMC, are both turning their eyes to the Barrens and the Dead Reaches in their race to reclaim lost systems and restore former glory.
