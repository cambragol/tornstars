<b>Lombard.</b>  Lombard was completely destroyed during the war, and has become home to a group of independent scavengers called the Aikenites. These tough settlers follow the teachings of Sal Aiken, who saw the value of taking what was broken, discarded or damaged, and making something new and useful from it. They have re-opened one of the stations in Lombard and operate it without any support from the Corporations or governments of the surrounding systems. They roam Lombard and surrounding systems in search of raw materials, debris, and spare parts to keep their odd-looking, cobbled-together ships operating. For the most part, this group will keep to themselves, and can often be traded with. However, they are fierce fighters when crossed, and attacking even one of their ships will bring the entire horde down on you very quickly, so don't do it. Similarly, if they see you as an ally, there is a good chance that they'll come to your assistance if you find yourself in trouble.
