<b>Providence.</b> This system was the site of a bitter battle between the Emperor and the rebel forces determined to break free of the empire after the war. Emperor Leung was determined to make a stand at Providence, with his remaining naval forces, to prevent the domino-like fall of any more systems from his sphere of control. As poorly equipped as the rebels were, they fought with tenacity and guerilla tactics to great effect, damaging and demoralizing the already weakened Imperial Fleet. The Imperial siege lasted for almost three years, destroying much of value to the local economy, while the rebels fought using hit and fade tactics. Finally, a famous suicide mission by the hero of Providence, Jim Barker, destroyed the last Imperial capital ship and four of its support vessels in one enormous blast, breaking the back of the Imperial forces and ending the siege. Emperor Leung's desperate bid to hold the deterioration of his empire here, failed. He was forced to retreat to Li Po and Xu Xuan in defensive maneuvers, and to consolidate his defenses in those relatively loyal systems. Providence remained free and independent for a time, but struggled with the lack of personnel and infrastructure with which to rebuild. The predations of piracy and crime also took their toll. Fortunately, the Providence Medical Complex thrived despite problems in the rest of the system. The quality of medical care delivered there made it the primary health care and medical training center for this entire region. It is also the base of operations of the roving hospital ships of the Providence Stellar Paramed. Eventually, as they saw Emerald emerge from its own disasters, they sought stronger trade and defense relations with this neighbor. Once the alliance was formed, it as a natural step to offer Providence membership status as well. Providence welcomed the military presence, security outposts and system defense stations the alliance built, not only for the protection this has offered against piracy, but also to match the Imperial military build up next door.
