<b>Alcuin.</b> Alcuin has been one of the mainstays of the Dead Reaches systems since the War of Dissolution. It was blessed with diverse resources, and only minor development at the time of the War of Dissolution, which meant it was largely ignored by those who fought for decades after the war. It became a place of refuge for many during the dark years, allowing a certain amount of development to occur at a time when most systems were dying. Unfortunately, the lack of support for the more costly aspects of development (building and operating new stations) simply wasn't there, which hampered their development beyond a certain point. Alcuin remained a small backwater system for some time, but continued to produce a steady supply of goods to neighboring systems when they most needed them. The Azran Corporation, then EtCom both saw potential in Alcuin, and began aggressive development there in their respective markets. Both served to complement one another, and the entire population of the system profited for a time. No central administration could rise to take the reins in the presence of these two corporate powers, making the system stuck in a constant state of debate over development issues. Bureaucratic fumbling and corporate bumbling left Alcuin ungoverned in the Dead Reaches star systems. It is, however, a system prime to become affiliated with the Emerald Alliance, once they can demonstrate the capacity to field security and naval forces.
