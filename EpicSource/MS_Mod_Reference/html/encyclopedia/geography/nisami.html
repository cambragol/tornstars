<b>Nisami.</b>  Nisami relied heavily on Corliss after the war, as the Sultanate and the League dissolved. Nisami had an abundance of potential fuel sources, but lacked the capacity to mine process and refine the materials on an economic scale. Corliss stepped in after the devastation of the war, and helped provide this infrastructure in return for exclusivity and good rates. For a long time, this arrangement has been beneficial to both, and has provided both systems with the economic and military strength they needed. Times are changing, memories are short, and Nisami producers are starting to feel the pinch of the low prices they get for their fuel from Corliss. Some defy the agreement and sell surreptitiously to other buyers, but they still lack the ability to provide fuel to ships on the scale that Corliss can provide.
