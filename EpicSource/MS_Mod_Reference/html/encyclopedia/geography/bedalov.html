<b>Bedalov.</b> The Bedalov was almost left unsettled after it was first opened up after survey, until a small neutronium-rich asteroid region as located. The rush to develop the system and mine this critical resource was funded by an ecstatic CMC and Emperor Leung. Unfortunately, after the processors, refineries, transfer stations, leisure stations, and security orbitals were constructed to support the mining industry, and the riches it would bring, it became clear that the original estimates of this deposits yield were grossly overstated. Almost as quickly as it had been built up, Bedalov mining enterprises were abandoned, and much of Bedalov emptied to other systems. Those who remained found new ways to exist, and some even found smaller neutronium deposits to exploit that were overlooked, ignored, or deemed uneconomical for extraction by the CMC. After the War when the Empire fought several rebellious systems as it declined, and then the entire cluster collapsed, the regional government of Bedalov was already well-prepared to survive without a central economy. It continues to be a small but steady supplier of mineral resources, as well as skilled miners, pilots and labourers. Ore processors, refineries and small stations are still being re-activated today, as Bedalov re-emerges. This system was one of the first to successfully cope with becoming a system of the Dead Reaches, and has been in the rebuilding phase for longer than most other systems, with a successful local government and law enforcement fleet. It is one of the few regions that is not in desperate need of people, and provides settlers and workforces for other systems.
