<b>Powys.</b> The Powys system is one of the sadder stories of the post-war Dead Reach systems. For a time it continued to thrive as a mining center, and as such, was seen as a place of relative stability by others fleeing local rebellions, skirmishes, and the other disasters that followed on the heels of the War of Dissolution. Refugee ships came by the dozen, each disgorging thousands of refugees onto the concourses of already strained stations. Conditions became unbearable. Life support systems could not cope with the strain, yet more ships still came, crying out for refuge. Finally, the inevitable occurred. Plague struck, and spread quickly to all the stations in the system before quarantine could be enforced. Thousands died in a very short time, many more died as infrastructure failed, stations collapsed, and word spread outward. Much needed help stayed away for fear of contamination. Though almost ninety years have passed since that time, the entire system continues to suffer from the stigma of plague. There are ghost stations that remain closed and quarantined. Few dare to travel in this system, but it is rumored that research at the medical orbital at Gruffydd was close to obtaining a cure when it, too was struck with the disease. It is also rumored that several infected refugee ships, blocked from the quarantine at the L-points, set out to T'Ang and to Huang using only low-level LDS. Many years have passed, but these ships are presumed to still be in transit somewhere. Both neighboring system administrations are uncomfortable with the possibility that the plague ships may reappear somewhere and begin to spread the disease again, as they are ill-equipped to deal with any such thing.
