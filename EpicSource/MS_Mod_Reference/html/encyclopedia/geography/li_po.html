<b>Li Po.</b> Li Po was to have become the second jewel in Emperor Leung's crown. The planet Chenyuang, though not truly Earthlike, had a remarkably similar biosphere, and could become another agricultural center if terra-forming efforts succeeded. Unfortunately, the war destroyed the bio-bomber being built at the time. Since then, the Emperor's priorities have been military strength, materials sciences, and biogenetic research, so no efforts to terraform Chenyuang have resumed. Although the domed colonies on the surface of Chenyuang are viable, and have begun to produce much-needed crops, the system still relies on the Gibbs agricultural orbital to feed the Empire. The regional governor would dearly like to change this, and it is rumored that he is plotting to sabotage the agricultural orbital to force the Emperor's hand. He would like to and see his system gain power and status to something greater than its current role as a fortified border defense state
