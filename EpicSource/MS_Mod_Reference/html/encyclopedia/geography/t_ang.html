<b>T'ang.</b>As one of the first systems colonized by the Leung dynasty and CMC joint venture, T'Ang was the first system where resources would be readily available. Minerals, frozen water and fuel essentials were all found in this system. Unfortunately, only a year later, Huang and then the An Chi systems were reached, and the Earth-like planet Emerald was discovered. This placed T'Ang in a backwater status right from the start. It was merely a stop-over on the way to An Chi, and not much of one, given that all travellers knew what awaited them at Emerald. The Leung Empire did not completely neglect it, though, as it was an important link to the route home via Sirius. Mining and processing facilities were constructed, and a strong military and customs presence was established, to ensure control of the trade into the Leung Empire from, what was originally believed to be the only route back home. Things changed, and once again, T'Ang slipped as a priority for the Leung Empire. It became little more than a military stronghold, with numerous outposts, stations, and leisure stations to keep the bored crew and troops entertained. The Independence War in the Commonwealth brought disaster through this region, as a large skirmishes spilled into this system. A few months later, early in the War of Dissolution, all traffic back through the L4 point toward the Sirius system was cutoff. All attempts to jump or connect failed. The route back was somehow either destroyed in some form of cataclysm, or intentionally blocked. No communications or ships ever returned from that direction. Almost a hundred years later, the route remains blocked, apparently from both approaches (outward from the home systems, or from T'Ang). Rumours have it that there is an unknown phenomenon blocking this route, either of a natural origin, or of alien design. Another popular theory for the cut off is that a powerful faction of the COSA fled up this arm to hide, to secretly build up its forces again, and it is they who are intentionally keeping this route closed. None of the rumours have been substantiated. The T'Ang of today has long since been abandoned by the Empire, and has lost most of its population. Those who remain, eke out an existence keeping the gas mining stations operational, and are struggling to resume ties with the Emerald Alliance. In an effort to restore their importance and viability, they remaining independent government send occasional probe missions toward Sirius. Nothing has ever come of these expeditions, and they are generally viewed as publicity and fundraising stunts. However, there has been a renewed interest in this venture by the Markus Corporation. Attempts to learn why the founder and CEO of this new but powerful information technology corporation, Mark Otomo, has invested millions in new expeditions into the 'dead' route have not been successful.
