<b>Al Qaan. </b>  (Ivory Garden). This binary star system offered little to the first survey ships and colonists except strong navigational jump points into the Middle States cluster from the home systems, and a sense of optimism. It was, an important foothold during the exploratory era. Once opened for settlement by the C.A.N., this was one of the first systems in the cluster to boast two agricultural orbitals. They served to feed the colonies before Emerald was settled, and served as the new Sultan's backup food source during the dark decades following the war of dissolution. Today, the Sultan and his local administrator Caliph Hasim, maintain numerous stations in this system to control the trade and emigration (now greatly reduced) that flow through here, as well as a backup garrison and military installation. It is also rumored that his secret police and military research facilities are based in this system. Smugglers have been a chronic problem in this region, as well as the black market trade of new weapon systems from the Sultan's armories in this system. Caliph Hasim has been the director of the Sultan's secret police forces in the past, and enjoys considerable support from them. His loyalty to the Sultan is strong, but many in the court have speculated that his loyalty is a merely ploy to win the affections of the Sultan's sister Karina.
