<b>Penda.</b> This system is the most recent addition to the Emerald Alliance, having recently petitioned for, and won member status in the last few years.  Though it was the site of two major fleet battles in rapid succession during the war, the few stations that were in this system were relatively spared. Two of the five prewar stations were utterly destroyed, and never rebuilt, but the remaining three survived, even after the population exodus. Unfortunately, it also remained a relatively undeveloped system for the decades that followed, falling to the mercy of the various pirate clans that settled in this system, over the years. One of the more successful criminal organizations, the Pimental family has survived the decades of skirmishes and power struggles within the pirate clans, and established itself as the de facto administration of the system. After implementing a punishing tax system-wide, the Pimentals recently pushed to rebuild the defense fleet, and successfully ousted some of the worst of the pirate gangs in Penda (and incidentally, former competitors), leaving those they could control alone. This gave the neighboring Emerald Alliance the impression of stability and lawfulness they were waiting for to admit Penda into the alliance. Emerald has been seeking to control the adjacent systems, not so much to create another empire, as to secure a well defended buffer zone around the only true garden world in the cluster. Admitting Penda into the alliance was another move in this direction, and Emerald is already constructing military outposts and a garrison station there. The low level of actual stability and lawfulness in Penda has not escaped the eye of Prime Speaker Holsworth of Emerald, and the Penda representative, Speaker Valenskaya, has yet to earn the trust and confidence of anyone in the Hall of Representatives.
