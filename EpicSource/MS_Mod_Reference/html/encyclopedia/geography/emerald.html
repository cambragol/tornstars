<b>An-Chi (Emerald).</b> Emerald is the only true garden world in this entire cluster, and as such is critically important to the entire region. Having already suffered disaster at the hands of the Sultan Malik Shah almost one hundred years ago, the people of Emerald are unlikely to allow such an abominable act to occur again. After rebuilding their cities and spaceports from the destruction wrought by the war, they have maintained a fierce sense of independence and protectiveness toward their world. The Capital city of Ch'ang-An continues to grow, but has been beautifully designed and rebuilt. It also boasts a new University (An-Chi University) and is a point of interest for many tourists and culture seekers. Emerald has also just recently completed construction of a new beanstalk, making orbital transport even more economical. The government is the closest thing to a democracy in this cluster, and has developed a good reputation under Prime Speaker Holsworth. Food production and water supply have been the bulwarks of Emerald's economy, but they are eager to foster other industries and develop other resources in order to complete the vision of pure independence and strength. Mining operations are popping up in this system, as are processing facilities, gas mining refineries, and manufacturing stations are all either under construction or in the contractor bidding phase. Ultimately Emerald is aware of the threat they pose to neighboring powers, if they succeed in their quest for independence and defensive strength, so they must constantly try to trade with others while building fleet strength, and enticing Dead Reaches systems or even Barrens systems to join their cause.
