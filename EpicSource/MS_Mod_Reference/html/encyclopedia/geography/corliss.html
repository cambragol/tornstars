<b>Corliss.</b>  This system managed to maintain independence throughout the War of Dissolution, and the dark decades that followed. Its strength has always been its adherence to the philosophy of free trade. This system boasts one of the largest trading stations spinward of New Constantinople. It also operates one of the stronger commodity exchanges in the entire sector. This trade base was further helped by its abundance of exotic metals and rare gems. Corliss is the system where everyone stops to trade, exchange goods, and relax a little at Boone's Saloon, while they gamble away some of their recently acquired gains. Since it is a stopover for almost every vessel in the vicinity, it has large ship docking, repair and servicing facilities. Passenger shuttles and taxis are a common sight as they ferry crew from their parked vessels to the various stations insystem. Fueling stations and fuel tenders are a common sight among the docked ships. Corliss made a very successful and lucrative deal with neighboring Nisami when it agreed to help them rebuild, as Nisami is one of the larger sources of fissionable material in the region. Corliss built the fuel processing stations and refineries in return for exclusive monopoly on the fuel at bargain prices. Today the conglomerate controls two systems, but their strength has weakened, somewhat in recent years due to slowed commercial trade traffic through their system. Slowed trade, fewer convoys, and talk of a new trade route, have all contributed to the economic slowdown. They also are showing signs of weakening from the continued harassment from all sides by Takanan Raiders, pirates, and CMC competitors. Together these forces have eroded the strength of the Corliss Conglomerate and its Defense Forces (CDF). Having relied heavily on arms purchases in the decades following the war, the CDF has not seen any fleet upgrades in the past fifty years. As with other systems, populations have emigrated faster than they could be replaced, leaving the local industry, CDF and tax based sorely depleted. The Corliss system would very much like to eliminate the CMC in Watts, as their trade practices have been ruthless over the years.
