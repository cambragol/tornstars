<b>Aleppo. </b> This is a mining-, processing- and manufacturing- rich system that was relatively spared the destruction of the War of Dissolution. It has been the domain of the Caliph Al Mansur and his family since the Sultanate was established. He is only somewhat loyal to the Sultan, and is always looking for an edge or a better deal. The current Caliph (Al Mansur II) is hoping that negotiations for the proposed jump gate will go well, so that construction can begin soon, this will make his system an important part of a new trade route, rather than one of the dead end systems. Others within the Sultanate, and along the Nisami-Watts corridor, would suffer if the jumpgate construction proceeded, so are constantly working against it. The Sultan himself is undecided about the potential benefits of the proposed jumpgate.
