<b>Saladin.</b>  This system was essentially wiped out during the War, and has taken over 70 years to rebuild its stations and industry base to a point where it could be considered viable again. This was another system from which the Sultanate withdrew during its time of crisis, leaving the wreckage of Saladdin vulnerable for raiders to plunder. The few surviving families of Saladdin have not forgotten this, and tend to be loyal to Caliph Al Hazen, instead. This system has always been seen as being of strategic value for its place along the trade route, as well as for its valuable water resources in this water-impoverished region of space. The population has been slow to rebuild since the slaughter during the war and the exodus that followed. Most of the current settlers have come from the Nureddin system, enticed by the strong incentive programs initiated by Caliph Al Hazen, of Yezhid. The Caliphate of Yezhid paid for rebuilding the stations and infrastructure in this system. As such, Al Hazen is unlikely to relinquish control of it, despite the Sultan's designs on it. There continues to be disputed claim for this system, and its much-needed water resources. Furthermore, the historical feud between the Caliph's family and the Sultan's continues to boil in this region. Caliph Al Hazen's ambitions irk the new Sultan, who wishes to restore the Sultanate to its former glory, and control Saladdin's water resource. The Sultan has sent ships into this system repeatedly, testing his neighbor's willingness to go to war, but has not yet successfully claimed sovereignty.
