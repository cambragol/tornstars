<b>Huang.</b> Huang was one of the first systems to feel the rumblings of rebellion from the Leung Empire. The War of Dissolution was all it needed to smash the Emperor's representative outposts in the system and declare their independence. The Empire made a punitive strike to set an example, but could not divert the forces needed to make this really effective. However, the imperial fleet managed to destroy two important ore processing facilities. After this damaging blow, Huang was largely left alone by the Imperial forces. Events at Emerald led the people of Huang to render considerable aid and support during Emerald's recovery. Huang was the first system to join with the Emerald system and helped create the Emerald Alliance. It has flourished in its partnership with Emerald, and continues to develop. They are currently negotiating to construct a jump gate to Aleppo, which would alter shipping and trade routes considerably. Knowing that there are several powers in the cluster that would suffer if the gate were completed, they are vigilant to the possibility of sabotage or outright attack. Security and military presence continues to be a priority for the administration of Huang, as they enter final negotiations with Aleppo. They are especially aware of Emperor Leung's bitterness at the loss of this system. His dreams of reuniting this 'lost colony' of cultural brothers are a very real threat to their current way of life, despite sharing similar racial and cultural heritage. They simply are not interested in Leung's plan. Huang's manufacturing capabilities are returning, but this system is most renowned for its ore processing and refining facilities. Miners from even remote systems will try to deliver ore here to obtain the best yield and grade of product available.
