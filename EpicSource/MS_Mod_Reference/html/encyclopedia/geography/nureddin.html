<b>Nureddin.</b>  This system was spared the destruction of the War of Dissolution, but was gutted by the treaty reparation costs and exodus of its population. It was abandoned by the Sultanate in its time of crisis. It is currently rebuilding, but slowly. Caliph Yezhid and his successors kept the system functioning despite the losses, and maintain successful trading posts, refineries and manufacturing facilities in the intervening years. Successful gas mines have been the staple of this systems' economy. Though it is off the main trade route, Nureddin is often visited by trade convoys for re-fueling and re-supply. The current Caliph Al Hazen has dedicated his entire Caliphate to the memory of his grandfather, Caliph Yezhid. He has re-named the Caliphate, and pursues his grandfather's dream of wealth, power and independence. The Mesa Corporation has established a manufacturing and trading station here, which has helped the Caliph in his rebuilding efforts. He is also building a state-of-the-art shipyard in this system to strengthen his fleet. He has grown tired of losing vast amounts of shipping and trade to pirates and Takanan Raiders. Shipping in this region has diminished over the last century as a result of relentless piracy, most notorious of these being the feared remnants of the 14th Cruisers (Takanan Raiders).
