Travel Prohibitions
</b>

<P>

A cult of religious zealots have taken control of the Ripon system. 
All attempts at diplomacy have been met with hostile fire.

Nisami/Watts Corridor
</b>
<P>
Most of the trade between The Sultanate and The Leung Empire moves up and down the 
Nisami/Watts corridor. 
These systems include the Corliss Conglomerate and the Consolidated Mining Corporation (Watts).
This trade corridor is the safest passage north to south. 
Security patrols are frequent and waystations and shipyards provide rapid service.

<b>
The Leung Empire

<P>
The southern Middle States is occupied by the manufacturing giant The Leung Empire. 
The manufacturing stations of the Empire supply most of the cluster with inexpensive goods.
The Empire purchases bulk minerals and high tech goods.
<P>
The Imperial Navy maintains a strong presence. 
Guards and customs patrols can be found on all borders.
Piracy is kept to a minimum within the Empire proper.

<b>
The Sultanate of Khalilistan
</b>

<P>
The northern Middle States is occupied by the wealthy and high tech Sultanate. 
The Sultanate has invested the wealth it earns from the exclusive Neutronium mines in Al Wadi
into high tech manufactures. 
These critical high tech components are in demand throughout the cluster.
<P>
The Sultanate employs a rather corrupt but efficient mercenary force to patrol 
the borders and collect taxes.

The Emerald Alliance

<b>
The Caliphate of Yezhid
</b>
<P>
The most 'Wester' reaches of the cluster are controlled by the Caliphate of Yezhid.  This small power is a breakaway state of the Sultanate of Khalilistan.  The system of Nureddin is still disputed between the two powers, and is the site of frequent skirmishes.  Currently the Caliphate is struggling to rebuild it's systems, and to expand it's economic strength and diversity.  The seat of government is situated in Nureddin, in orbit around the moon of Jiddah.
