<b>Omayyad (Epitaph).</b>  Epitaph earned its name after becoming the cemetery for so many thousands during the war. Not only were settlements wiped out, the entire Leung dynasty fleet met its doom in this system. Littered with dense bands of rocky rubble, asteroids and planetoids, Epitaph was an ideal place to trap invaders in minefields and hidden defense networks. During the great battle of Omayyad, an antimatter explosion shattered one of the small moons, changing navigation in this system forever. The jump point to Penda was lost, though some, it is rumored, continue to use a subsidiary point for the same jump. After the destruction of this system, and a battle that decimated two fleets, The League of Independent Stars collapsed and scattered before the system could be cleaned up or made safe. Very few ships even tried to visit this system for many years after the war. This isolation left survivors little choice but to flee, or to scavenge an existence from the hundreds of wrecked ships left behind. Unfortunately, mines and booby traps made even this kind of existence very difficult. Epitaph has become one of the most dangerous regions of space to traverse. A few pirate clans and scavengers have settled there, feeding the stories and lore that have built around this tomb-like system in order to maintain their privacy. But the lore does not need to exaggerate much, as the dangers in this region are very real. Many have tried to take a shortened route through this system only to disappear or join the host of drifting dead ships.
