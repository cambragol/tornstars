<b>Kronholm.</b> This system, and its major planets, originally named for the members of the survey team that discovered this critically linking system, Kronholm was later developed and settled primarily by Emperor Leung's interests. In addition to being an important trade link for the Leung Empire, Kronholm served as a manufacturing powerhouse and a defense stronghold throughout the long years of reconstruction. The two shipyards in Kronholm were largely responsible for saving the Empire from further decline in the face of the population exodus and constant skirmishes in the sector. Rarely credited with their role in maintaining the strength of the Empire, Kronholm has long believed that they would be better off without the Emperor, and have been threatening an independence movement for years. The Emperor is all too aware of the importance of this manufacturing and production base, and will not likely let Kronholm leave the Empire without a fight. As a 'border' system in his dwindling Empire, he has fortified it and maintains a strong military presence in Kronholm.
