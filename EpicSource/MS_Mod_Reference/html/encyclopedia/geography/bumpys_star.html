<b>Bumpy's Star.</b> Bumpy Clark was a rugged small-time prospector and miner who hailed from the Australian outback. The origin of his nickname remains a mystery, but apparently he was not a very good pilot. Bumpy was surveying the Alcuin system, scouring it for good claims when he came upon a LaGrange point that looked like it could zip him across the system more quickly than LDS could. So he jumped. He emerged in an entirely different system that noone had visited as yet. It was FULL of good claims. This system has an ample supply of good mineral resources, and one of the roughest and most popular bars and gambling establishments this side of Corliss. The Leung dynasty has been eager to reclaim this system and its many mineral-rich asteroids for the Emperor, but have been thwarted by the system's de facto owners, the Doran Asteroid Mining Network. DAMN, also referred to as The Network, was originally a collection of smaller independent mining operations that set up mineral extraction operations in the sites abandoned by the old Imperial Industrial Institute. As they continued to pull mineral riches out of mine sites deemed unprofitable by III, they grew in strength, and banded together for protection. They employ a large number of mercenary defenders, but they also receive support from a local crime syndicate, interested in keeping their leisure station open and profitable. Eventually the Doran Network acquired the wealth to re-open Woomera Station, their current HQ, and is in the early stages of building a processor of their own in-system. This alone could save them considerable shipping and processing costs. Unfortunately, this will also place them further out of reach of the Leung dynasty, which would like to see a halt to the construction on the processor, and to see the entire Doran Network go away.

As out-of-the-way as this system is, it manages to see a fair amount of traffic coming in for its seedy entertainment, well-stocked bars, and gambling. It's a good place for a newcomer to look for a job!
