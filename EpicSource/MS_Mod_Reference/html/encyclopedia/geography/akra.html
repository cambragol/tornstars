<b>Akra.</b>  This system was one of many that were devastated during the War of Dissolution. It has become a haven for pirates over the past century, though a mercenary clan called the Fist of Akra has recently resettled this region in an effort to reclaim it. They have built two bases in remote asteroid strongholds, and make frequent patrols of the system in an effort to discourage piracy. The last decade has seen an increase in corporate interest, as both the CMC, and the Fonseka Foundation have proposed establishing bases and processing facilities. There is an active effort to resettle this system, but the decades of lawlessness and violence since the war continue to scuttle their efforts.
