<b>Ripon.</b>  This system, was less devastated as a direct result of the war, but lost its population when the trade route vanished. The system was essentially abandoned by any political or economic entities, but became home to groups of persecuted religious fanatics. One such group, calling themselves the Brethren of Salvation established themselves here in the last decade. Since then almost nothing has been heard from the system. News simply does not come out. A recent mining expedition encountered the Brethren, and were wiped out save for a single tug that managed to jump back to Li Po. They reported that the Brethren attacked without provocation in the most brutal fashion imaginable, methodically killing any lifeboats, comsecs, or vac-suited individuals. Apparently, the Brethren see themselves as the scythe of god, saving souls by expediting their arrival into the bosom of the lord. They see it as their sacred duty to bring their ministry of salvation to everyone they encounter by killing the mortal flesh and freeing the immortal soul. Except for a few brave traders who keep them supplied, everyone who encounters them, dies. Bounties have been offered, but none successfully collected. For the time, they are confined to Ripon, but there is concern that they will run out of survivors and risk-takers in that system, and try to bring their twisted salvation to neighboring systems. Before the Brethren took this system, Breakdown Rock was a point of interest to spacefarers and navigational researchers, in that a mysteriously disproportionate number of vessels experienced significant systems failures when traveling in the vicinity of this body. There is no known reason for this effect, but numerous abandoned hulks still drift in this asteroid's L points.
