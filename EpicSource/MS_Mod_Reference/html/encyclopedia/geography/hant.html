<b>Hant.</b>  Hant is considered to be one of the Barrens, as it lacks any permanent administrative or security presence on the abandoned and ruined stations still in this system. However, this system, with its many planets and moons, became the hiding place of the 14th Cruisers after the war. What was once a well-equipped fleet of the fastest military ships soon became a ragtag band of pirates, resorting to extortion from trade convoys for 'protection', pressgangs for personnel, and outright piracy in order to keep their fleet operating. Though none of the current Takanan officers were living at the time of the War of Dissolution, they continue to see themselves as the keepers of the ideals of the 14th Cruisers of the League of Independent Stars. They have maintained their enmity of the Sultan and the Caliphates, striking their convoys wherever possible. They also would like to see the end of the CMC, a corporation they see as being responsible for their downfall and exile. Rumor has it that they have rebuilt a station in the system using remains of the smashed derelicts from one hundred years ago. No one has successfully located it, though (and lived to tell). Ultimately, they would like to return to legitimacy and light, in order to pursue their dream of rebuilding Lombard, but have been on the wrong side of the law for so long they have forgotten how. The amnesty they require would be difficult, but not impossible to obtain. The 14th Cruisers would be powerful allies for any ambitious individual seeking a private navy.
