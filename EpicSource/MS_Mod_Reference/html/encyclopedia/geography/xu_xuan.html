<b>Xu Xuan.</b> This system has been the Empire's military production base since the time of the War of Dissolution. Though it lacks many planets, it has a few planetoids and asteroids amidst a host of asteroid belts, offering perfect shelter for covert labs. These rings of rubble hide the Emperor's secret research laboratories, starship construction shipyards, processing and manufacturing stations, and a military training facility that has been steadily and quietly building capacity and stockpiling supplies. Emperor Leung is unnaturally old (he was an elderly man when this cluster was surveyed and opened for development), and has spent the last hundred years clinging to life through the longevity research conducted at his Biosciences Complex. It is a personal obsession of his. He is rarely seen in public, and remains close to the team of bioscientists who keep him alive. The genetics research divisions of the Markus Corporation and the Mustapha Institute would love to know what goes on in these labs. There are rumors of Human vivisection and experimentation, but none have been substantiated. The other less successful obsession of Emperor Leung, is developing a substitute for Neutronium. The materials research labs in this system have tried for decades to produce a substitute fission containment system, but without success. One such failure vaporized several hundred thousand cubic Kilometers of asteroid field in the Long March Belt, along with an entire research facility and some of his brightest minds in an instant. His efforts continue, and it is rumored that a low yield reactor prototype is scheduled for testing in one of his older naval vessels soon. If successful, it may go into production quickly. CMC would also pay very dearly to learn about what goes on in the Emperor's materials and processing research facilities. Unfortunately this research focus has prevented advances in other important ship technologies, such that his navy is less well shielded and armoured than some of the others in the sector. The Empire continues to enjoy one advantage, though: Numbers. The production facilities in Xu Xuan have been churning out large numbers of corvettes, patcoms, and fighters for years. Though older in design, and inferior in a one-on-one duel, the sheer numbers of these vessels should give any foe reason to pause.
