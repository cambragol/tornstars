<b>Al Wadi. </b>  This binary system was first logged as AL-2440. Re-named Al Wadi, it has been the source of contention of the new Sultan and his Caliphs since the war ended. It has seen its share of raids and battles, as it has changed hands several times in the past hundred years, but none of the clashes over Al Wadi have lasted very long, as ships' systems tend to break down quickly in this sector. This star system is punishing to any ship or station. Mining vessels and transports require considerable shielding and constant upkeep to operate in this system. The few stations in the systems are positioned in the periphery, and require a constant flow of immigrant workers and specialists, as the workforce is continually rotated. The general trend has always been to get in, get the stuff, and get out of this system as quickly as possible, processing and refining can take place outside of the system, even if it is costly to move so much ore. There is one exception to this trend: Neutronium is the biggest product from this system, but it must first be converted from raw ore at the immense processor in-system, before it can be then transported out to the Sultan's refineries in New Constantinople and Aleppo. Currently under the administration of Caliph Karim, under tight supervision of the Sultan, this system is the source of the Sultan's power and wealth. As such, it is very well protected.
