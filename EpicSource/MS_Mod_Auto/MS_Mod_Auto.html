Middle States Autopilot Watch

<hr>
<p>Version 8.0 Oct 9, 2005</p>

<p>
This mod package activates an Autopilot watch task that prevents the player from using the 
autopilot to route courses from system to system. 

The purpose is to prevent an autopilot bug that will jump the player over multiple systems, 
breaking the economic calculations.
