Torn Stars : Middle States Cluster

<hr>
<p>Version 8.1beta  Nov 9, 2005</p>

<p>
This mod package contains the geography files for the Torn Stars: Unstable Space Middle States cluster.
This is a beta version meant for distribution amongst developers only.
It is not a stand alone mod, but must be used with a supporting planet and
nebula textures, as well as the base Torn Stars install.  Be sure to deactivate the standard Geog and activate this one in its place.
