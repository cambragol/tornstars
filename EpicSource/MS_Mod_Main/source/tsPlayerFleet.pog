// Functions specific to handling the player fleet. Player and wingmen death scripts.
// Query functions related to the player fleet.
// 
// Nov 2006, Jon Freise
//
// There are a few main entry points for player wingmen
// HireShip is used when the player hires a wingman for service. 
// CaptureShip is used when the player siezes a ship.
// SetupPlayerWingman is used in the general case of purchasing a ship (not a standard feature).
// and is used to restore the wingmen after load.
//
// There are a few main entry points for the player.
// PlayerDeath is the death script that handles the players ship being destroyed.
// SetupPlayer is used during restore to attach all proper items to the player ship.
// NewPlayerShip is used when the player purchases a ship, via menu. It will 
// setup that ship properly, and change the inventory to match the ship.
