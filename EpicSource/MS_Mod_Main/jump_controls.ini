[Damage]
; Damage is delt as a random amount for each level that the jump
; is harder than the capsule drive.
; So a commercial drive crossing a dangerous route would take 4-1=3 levels of damage.
; Damage is in percent of ship hit points total.

[Drives]
; This is the level of instability that the drive can 
; cross without damage.
; There are only two classes of drives in the game.

;commercial crosses only stable routes without damage.

;military can cross unstable routes or better without damage.

[Ships]
; These ships are used by the jump simulation to emulate the capsule drive.
; The template used is the one matching the drive value specified in the
; drives section.
;
; The basic idea here is to have one selection for each level 
; of capsule drive supported.
; The commercial level should handle poorly, with lots of inertia
; The military version should be better, with more accel
