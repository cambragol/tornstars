Ship Mail
<hr>
<p>Von Schelling Industries welcomes you to Ship Mail, 
an exciting new way to receive Email messages. 
 Ship Mail allows 
you to use your powerful shipboard computer systems for viewing 
personal mail. Why carry a PDA when you have a Compact AI?

<p>The Ship Mail screen is split into two areas. The top area is 
the message viewing area. 

<p>Just below the message text are two buttons. 

<p>The first button is the Delete/Save button. 
Use this button to delete unwanted messages. To keep missions from crashing,
Von Schelling Industries recommends waiting to delete messages until after the mission is complete.
Deleting keeps save game files smaller. 

<p>Some short life messages, like this one, display a
save button instead of delete. Press save if you would like to keep this message for
future reading. Unless you save, short life messages are conveniently deleted when you 
return to base.

<p>There is also an Accept button. This helpful button allows you to accept job
offers or other bargains from message senders. Press this button now to Register Ship Mail. 
Registration allows us to serve you better.

<p>The bottom screen area has two lists of messages. The top list is for new messages. 
The bottom list holds messages you have already read. Mouse Click any message to view 
the contents in the message window.

<p>Ship Mail allows you to view other exciting message sources! 

<p>Network 54 provides up to date information on the events happening in the Middle States cluster. 
Updated around the clock. Check back often for the latest News. A free basic subscription to 
Network 54 is provided with your Ship Mail purchase.  This basic subscription will include the most important news and events from around the cluster.  For more detailed and specific reports contact us about upgrading to a Targetted, Total, or Caster subscription.

<p>Von Schelling Industries thanks YOU for purchasing Ship Mail and wishes you many happy hours of use.
