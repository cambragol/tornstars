Cargo Purchase Screen

<hr>
<p>This screen allows you to purchase cargo pods from the station.

<p>The player ship which will carry the cargo pods must dock with the station.  

<p>Cargo loading is an automated process.  The cargo carrying ship cannot interrupt this process and must wait for its completion.
