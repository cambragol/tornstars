<P>You are starting with the most basic of commercial ships, the 'Spider Tug'.  Minus the money spent on the tug, you have 200000 credits left in your account.  You have hired an SNRV cargo shipped, called the 'Haul-E'.  You worked with Azran corporation for 15 years and can consider them an ally.  You also have very friendly relations with CMC Mining and Imperial mining, two companies you frequently dealt with.  On the shadier side of things you also have garnered the trust and friendship of influential members of the Lindevall family, and can consider them friends.
With you come your companions of late Az and Lori.
<P>
Your plan is to head straight to Common Metals Mine One, to pick up some ore.  From there you figure you can spend a little time doing the run between there and the Common Metals Processing.  Very low profit, but safe and simple.  Once you have the basics of trade grasped, it will be time to search out a profitable route between Alcuin and Bedalov, or perhaps even Emerald.
