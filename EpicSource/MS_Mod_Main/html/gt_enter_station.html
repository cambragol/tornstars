Enter Station

<p> 
Press this button to enter the station where you are docked.
Once inside the station you can access the stations hanger and change the loadout of your ship.
Launching from the station will place you back outside this station, 
with your ship docked, just as you left it. 
Any wingmen that you had parked outside the station will be there when you return.

<p>You can also save from inside the station. 
When you load, you will return to the inside of the station.

<p>You can also save in deep space. Travel at least 1000km from any station and check the menu again.
