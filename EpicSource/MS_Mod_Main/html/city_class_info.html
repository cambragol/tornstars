MS-FR100 City Class Light Freighter
<hr>
<p> 
The City class light freighter has replaced the older <a href="ore_freighter.html">Oakland
class</a> as the freighter of choice for medium sized shipping companies. Its
low crew requirements and relatively large 10 pod cargo capacity, make it an
obvious choice.
