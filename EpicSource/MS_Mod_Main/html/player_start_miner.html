You are starting with a very nice complement of ships, including 2 mining rigs, a mid-sized fuel ship, a 10 pod freighter, both a small and large science ship (for scanning and surveying) and a prospector ship (which can scan, survey, and mine).

<P>
You are currently positioned in the x472 system, an as yet unexplored system.  Please use all the ships and systems at your disposal to exploit as much as you can from the asteroids you will find here.  You will likely be looking for Biomass Processing Plants or Commen Metals Processing once you churn out a few pods.  Look for those in Li Po, or elsewhere.  Good luck!
