You are starting with the most basic of commercial ships, the 'Truck'.  You have worked hard, for years, slaving away at dead end jobs on the Archer Waystation in the Lombard system.  At last though, the ship you ordered has arrived, and you are free to make your fortune amongst the stars.  With you come your most trusted comrades in misfortune, Lori and Azraelle who will aid you in navigation, communications and engineering.

<P>
You still have 30000 credits in your account with which you hope to get started with some basic mineral hauling, or perhaps staking some claims on one of the abandoned but still possibly lucrative mining claims in the region.  That or perhaps a little shadier class of dealings.  In anycase, until you can find or fight your way clear of the ruin called the Lombard system, you will need to tread carefully in these 'Barrens' lest you bankrupt yourself and end up without a ship, once again trapped on one of the forsaken metal boxes that pass for the homes of humanity in this cluster.
