You are starting with a small pirate armada, consisting of an armed tug, two patcoms and two older dreadnaughts.  

<P>
You are currently positioned near Golligers Fort,a mercenary base in the Bedalov system.  You are allied with the Golligers faction, and are using their station as a base for raiding in this system and Alcuin.  You are at open war with the Etcom and CMC Mining factions, and have nearly provoked open war with Chavez Shipping, the biggest faction in the Bedalov system.  Things are heating up for you here, and with the disappearence of your last fence in this system, it may be time to move your operations elsewhere, such as Alcuin or Powys.  See how far you can take your piracy!
