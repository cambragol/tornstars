Sell Claim Screen

<hr>
<p> 
Prospectors may sell the claims they have discovered here.
After an asteroid is surveyed using a science ship, it will be claimed by you.

<p>
If you do not have the funds to exploit your discoveries, you may sell them to Megacorporations. 
Open this screen near a megacorporation owned station and a sell button will appear.

<p>
You can use this screen to abandon a claim at any time. Asteroids with Unusable levels of ore are not worth keeping.
