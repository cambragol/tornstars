Rest Day Description

<hr>
<p> This GUI button allows your fleet to pass a day of time. 
It will only function while there are no hostile ships nearby.


<p>The screen will go dark for several seconds and a game day will pass.


<p>Resting for a day is very useful while waiting for prospecting ships to finish 
or while waiting for mining rigs to generate ore. Your fleet will be charged 
upkeep and fuel costs for the day.
