<p>Select a ship in the list on the left for details.

<p>Fuel Remaining indicates the exact amount of fuel current stored in the selected ship.

<p>Your Funds displays the amount of money you have in your accounts. 

<p>Daily Upkeep is the daily cost of operating a ship (ship repair, crew, and spare parts) measured in credits. 

<p>Fuel Per Day is the amount of fuel the ship will use in a day carrying out normal operations, excluding capsule jumps.

<p>Approx. Fuel Per Jump is the approximate amount of fuel needed to capsule jump the ship from one system to another.  The actual cost of the jump will flucuate slightly, based on the stability of the Lpoint, with less stable lpoints requiring more fuel. Capsule jumps within the same system use so little fuel as to be considered fuel usage free.
