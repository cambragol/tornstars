Your Fleet Status 

<hr>
<p>This screen displays the accounting information for your fleet.

<p>Select a ship in the list on the left for details.

<p>The Daily Upkeep is the daily cost of operating a ship (ship repair, crew, and spare parts). 

<p>The Fuel Per Jump is the amount of fuel needed to capsule jump the ship from one system to another. The cost is in credits. Capsule jumps within the same system are free. 

<p>Fuel Used is the amount of fuel the ship has used jumping, but has not yet charged your account. This amount will be charged at end of the day.

<p>Funds displays the amount of money you have in your accounts. 

<p>Each capsule jump from system to system takes one day to complete. You will be billed for both the jump fuel and the daily upkeep cost of the ship. If you cannot pay for your wingmen's fuel or upkeep they will desert. 

<p>You can fire a wingman at any time by using the communication system (target the wingman and press "c").
