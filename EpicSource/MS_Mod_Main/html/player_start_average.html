<P>You are starting with a very standard commercial combat ship, the 'Storm Petrel'.  Minus the money spent on the ship you have 200000 credits left in your account.  You have hired an SNRV cargo shipped, called the 'Big Tripper'.  It is minimally armed, so will rely heavily on your protection.  You worked with UCP or "Universal Consumer Products" for 15 years and can consider them an ally.  You also have very friendly relations with CMC Mining, the Aikenites and the mercenary Gargoyles.  Unfortunately you have run afoul of the Droznic family, and can consider them *very* unfriendly.  With you come your companions of late Az and Lori.
<P>
Your plan is to head straight to Asteroid Base Hunter, to pick up some ore.  From there you figure you can spend a little time doing the run between there and the Bentley Processing Factory.  Very low profit, but safe and simple.  Once you have the basics of trade grasped, it will be time to search out a profitable route between Lombard and Watts, or perhaps even Kronholm or Corliss.
