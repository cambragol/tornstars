Yellowstone Truck
<hr>
<p> 
A very common and versitile ship found throughout the Middle States in numerous roles.  It is popular in mining, exploration, servicing and even combat.  
It's single external mount allows it to switch between mining lasers and Quad Lite PBC's with ease.  However, it is very thinnly armored and cannot sustain much damage.
