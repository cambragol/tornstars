You are starting with the most basic of commercial ships, the 'Truck'.  You have worked hard, for years, slaving away at dead end jobs on the Pimental Ship Base in Penda system.  At last though, the ship you ordered has arrived, and you are free to make your fortune amongst the stars.  With you come your most trusted comrades in misfortune, Lori and Azraelle who will aid you in navigation, communications and engineering.

<P>
You still have 15000 credits in your account with which you hope to get started with some basic mineral hauling, or intrastellar station to station transport.  That or perhaps a little shadier class of dealings.  Thanks to your friendly relations with the Pimental family, you can't help but wonder whether you might just fall into their 'trade'.  In that case the first step will be in earning enough credits to arm your ship....
