<n>After twenty four years of defending against hostile factions, predators, pirates, and simple lawbreakers, the Corliss Defence Force is finally receiving new ships to bolster its aging fleet. Most of the vessels currently in service for the CDF are veterans of the War of Dissolution. While they have been maintained and upgraded, they are simply not adequate to the task of meeting Corliss' present-day defence needs. Director Mastrantonio recently approved the allocation of substantial resources into the defence budget, paving the way to fleet orders for both stationary defences and fleet upgrades. We are unable to report on the specifics, due to a publication ban while the contracting and manufacturing bidding is still in progress. However, there has been speculation that the CDF is favouring the Devastator-class Heavy corvette, and the Advanced PatCom model, despite the elevated cost per unit of these vessels. It is unknown how long it will take for the new fleet to become operational, but sources indicate the entire program is being fast-tracked to address the deteriorating situation with the CMC. The CMC defence fleet is also in need of rejuvenation despite the long-time successes they've seen with their Terrapin-class armed patrol vessels.”
