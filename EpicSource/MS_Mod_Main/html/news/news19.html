<n>Although both the Emerald Alliance and the Sultanate of Khalilistan have signed the jumpgate treaty, and agreed to begin construction on these costly facilities, neither has been able to get beyond the blueprint stage. Charges of corruption and nepotism in the contractor bidding process have stalled the Sultanate's efforts in Aleppo, and labour union disputes within the Emerald Alliance have prevented workers from doing anything beyond assembling onsite port-a-potties at Huang's designated L-point. Suppliers and manufacturers are furious at the costly delays. It seems unlikely that this controversial project will see construction begin before the end of the calendar year, if ever. Opponents of the jumpgate at Corliss were unavailable for comment, but the value of market shares of Saffron Industries and the CMC soared in todays trading, speaking clearly in favour of the Nisami-Watts shipping corridor for most commercial traffic for some time to come.
