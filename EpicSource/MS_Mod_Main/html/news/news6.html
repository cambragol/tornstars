<n>Sources in the Fonseka Foundation revealed shocking statistics on the shipping losses to piracy in the Barrens systems. The past year has seen a threefold increase over the previous year in lost tonnage in the Akra and Hant systems alone. Fortunately the figures for lives lost show a less disturbing rise. Nevertheless, the losses are significant and unacceptable, according to the Transportation Directorate at Corliss, the most powerful body within the Conglomerate's government. Police and local militia forces have reacted to the statistics with renewed calls for resources to replenish their thinning ranks. “We have been trying to do the impossible with too few ships and men,” stated a spokesperson for the Corliss Police force. “We need more resources, not more promises. This kind of thing will only drive up fees for the mercenaries.”
