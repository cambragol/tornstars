<n>Confusion abounds on the heels of the recent announcement of the closure of a major neutronium ore extraction site in Al Wadi. Answers are in as short supply as neutronium in this development that has most industry analysts scratching their heads, especially following the announcements only two months ago about the discovery of new deposits of neutronium in the same system. No reason was given for the closure, beyond the vague statement that it had become “un-economical to continue operations at this site.” This has fueled speculations that there has been a major accident, which has damaged the mining infrastructure. Others have speculated about labour problems, from plague to rumours of an all-out strike over wages that was ended violently. The most pessimistic analysts have even suggested that the announcements of abundant neutronium deposits made two months ago were politically and economically motivated, and that the reality is simple: the neutronium supply in Al Wadi is dwindling or almost exhausted.
