<n>The mystery behind the disappearance of over sixty vessels in Ripon last year may have finally been solved. A survivor has granted an exclusive interview with Network 54, in which she described a brutal, unprovoked attack by a squadron of well-armed vessels in Ripon calling themselves the Brethren of Salvation. <i>‘They screamed this gospel stuff, then they started shooting. We didn't stand a chance. We surrendered; we begged…it didn't matter. They just kept firing until there was nothing bigger than a cooling unit left. If I hadn't been suited for EVA and protected by a piece of hull plating I wouldn't have made it.' </i>Said the survivor, who wished to have her identity protected.

Dr. Farhad Mayhew, a Professor of Sociology at the University of Tulun, has described a very similar fanatic cult in his book ‘Crucible of Faith: The New Rise of Violent Religious Cults in Remote Colonial Space'. Based on information gathered by Aikenites, with whom they seemed to be willing to trade for supplies, Dr. Mayhew described a group very similar to ‘The Brethren'. ‘The Shepherds', as they called themselves, were a cult dedicated to purifying and bringing to paradise the souls of all those who have lost their way on the path to heaven by wandering into the ‘false heaven' of interstellar space. They would pray for, then attack and utterly destroy any ship they encountered, believing that they were saving the souls of the people on board from endless wandering in the purgatory of space. They did not board vessels, steal supplies, nor negotiate. They simply attacked unannounced, and wiped out everything in their path, as part of their evangelical mission.  Although the group described in Dr. Mayhew's book were themselves destroyed in a police action over a decade ago, it is believed that another variant of this cult has organized in Ripon; these so-called ‘Brethren'. Governor Peng of Li Po has vowed that the Brethren will not be permitted to spread their gospel of death in the Imperial systems. <i>“If they come here looking to purify any of our souls, they will quickly find themselves purified by Imperial PBCs.”</i> Said Peng. Travel advisories have been issued by all government and corporate officials, cautioning against any travel to Ripon until this cult has been dealt with.
