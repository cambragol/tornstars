<n>Prospector rumors that there may be Neutronium ore in commercial quantities in the asteroids of Alcuin sent the trade market at New Constantinople into chaos today. Heavy trading and speculating resulted in wild fluctuations on Ouali Street, closing at a twelve year low for the Sultanate. The Leung Empire has been searching for a source of the essential ore, or an artificial substitute for decades, in order to remove its dependence on Al Wadi. The Empire's economy also reacted to the news with heavy trading activity. While the news of potential competition weakened the Sultanate economy, the Leung Empire reacted much more positively, and quickly. New grants to fund independent prospecting operations in the Dead Reaches systems were announced by Magistrate Radicz at close of the trading day.
