<n>Hugo Chavez, senior executive of Chavez Shipping Corporation has officially joined the trade and defense delegation bound for Emerald next month to negotiate the terms for potential membership in the Emerald Alliance. Most of the Dead Reaches systems are hoping that negotiations will succeed, bringing the highly desired benefits of Alliance membership to this region of space. The question on everyone's mind is whether the addition of Chavez will help or harm our chances for success.

Other members of the Delegation include representatives from Azran Corporation, EtCom, the Doran Asteroid Mining Network, and Universal Consumer Products. System administrators from Bumpy's Star, Alcuin, and Bedalov all plan to participate in the upcoming talks as well. The composition of this delegation has been controversial, to say the least, with UCP's suspected ties to the Lindevaal crime family, and the recent withdrawal of Mark Otomo of Markus Corporation from the delegation. Chavez Shipping stirs the mix even more, with its recent acquisition of at least two new megafreighters clearly intended to expand shipping routes into the Sultanate of Khalilistan. Although there have been no acts of open hostility between the Sultanate and Emerald for years, these two factions are barely on speaking terms, raising questions among other delegates about the wisdom of allowing Chavez to join negotiations with the Emerald Alliance for membership. The meeting is scheduled to take place at an unannounced date and location, sometime next month. MelNet News Source will provide you with the unfolding story, as it happens.
