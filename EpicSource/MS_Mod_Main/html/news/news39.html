<n>Combining their strengths, the research teams at the technology institute in the Caliphate of Yezhid and those of the Mustapha Institute have decided to set aside their differences in hopes of making dramatic improvements on sensor technology. While the potential technological benefits have most spacecraft operators applauding the move, the collaboration signals a warming of relations in this region. There are no signs of change in the military activities of either Sultanate of Caliphate of Yezhid naval forces, as both governments continue their war of nerves over disputed territory in Saladdin.
