<n>The Dead Reaches systems fear a new outbreak of the deadly Necrotizing Mucosa Syndrome, or NMS plague that devastated Powys fifty years ago. Unconfirmed rumours of new NMS cases reported in Bedalov shook the entire region, still nervous after the plague ended a generation ago. Rumours of several NMS cases in Powys have prompted a swift response from both Medical and Public Relations teams. Full precautions were taken when medical teams rushed to investigate the stricken mining colony, but were relaxed when public relations officers stated that the illness was not the dreaded plague, despite concerns expressed by medical experts. The Public Relations offices assures the member states of the Dead Reaches that they are still open for business and there is no need to fear another outbreak of the NMS plague. Furthermore, they denied any connection between the medical emergency and the tragic accident that resulted in the complete destruction of the afflicted colony, claiming everyone at the base. A full inquiry has been ordered into the system failure that resulted in the venting of the entire base, claiming one hundred and eighty seven lives, including the medical response team who were attempting to return home at the time of the accident.
