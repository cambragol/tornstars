<n>Terrorists sabotaged and almost destroyed a habitat station in Al Wadi yesterday. The Sultan's Minister of Information made a public statement this morning confirming that seventy eight people, mostly foreign labourers employed in the neutronium extraction facilities nearby, were instantly killed when their section of the station was depressurized in a cowardly attack. The remaining inhabitants of the station have been evacuated while it is stabilized and repaired. Leung's terrorists have shifted their tactics in recent years, as security around the extraction, processing and refining facilities has thwarted most of their efforts to damage neutronium production in this system.  Labour that is critical to the continued production of neutronium is imported from virtually every sector of the Middle States cluster, making the workers targets for Leung's violence.  The Minister vowed to find the perpetrators of yesterday's attack and bring them to justice.

In related news, a spy working for the Leung Empire was captured today at the University of Tulun, and imprisoned at the Ivory Garden security station. Posing as a Professor of Linguistics, the undercover agent was in frequent contact with known Leung sympathizers and operatives. The chief of security operations said it was only a matter of time before the spy would make a critical mistake, leading to his identification and capture. The trial and execution are scheduled for tomorrow.
