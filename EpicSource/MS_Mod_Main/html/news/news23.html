<n>Academic freedom and the right to free speech suffered serious blows today when a Professor of Linguistics at the University of Tulun at New Constantinople was arrested and imprisoned today for voicing his views against the Sultan. After receiving a warning a year ago from the Dean and Department heads regarding his anti-Sultan teachings, Abdul Moran spoke out again yesterday at a public function. Within hours he was in custody of the Sultan's secret police, and will likely not be seen again alive. The Sultan's cruel grip on those in his regime has tightened more than ever. However, no matter how firmly he tries to control his people, the labour force he relies on continues to diminish yearly. Seventy-eight foreign workers died yesterday in Al Wadi, under the brutal mining conditions and unsafe environments in which they are forced to labour for the Sultan's obscene enrichment.”
