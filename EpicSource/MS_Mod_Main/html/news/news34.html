<n>Despite many problems with security encountered in the past, the Corliss system will soon be filling with the very beautiful, and the extremely wealthy as the 21st annual Corliss Derby gets under way. Rivals from all sectors of the Middle States (and a few from other clusters) are gathering at Boone's Saloon (Boone Leisure Complex) at Gault in preparation for the notorious race. Teams from Ivory Garden, Nureddin, Watts, even as far as Tau Tsun are assembling their crews and the fastest ships in known space. These incredibly powerful, highly modified and expensive yachts will compete for the coveted Golden Joystick, as they try to be the first to collect markers in sequential order from all 27 systems in the cluster. They must then race back to the starting point at Boone's in Corliss. Speed is always an important factor, as is skill in navigation, but past Derby's have shown that combat survival skills are important, too. Takanan Raiders, pirates, the deadly defense machines in Epitaph, and border skirmishes have eliminated a few contestants in each of the last twenty one races; sometimes permanently. This year's Derby will be the first to enjoy increased security patrols along the entire length of the Nisami-Watts portion of the course. The promise of additional security does not seem to have assured Markus Otomo. The wealthy playboy, crack pilot and winner of the last four races withdrew his team's entry last week, giving no explanation. Although they were this year's favourites again, the mysterious withdrawal of team Otomo, has created an exciting stir amongst the remaining competitors, as this has become anybody's race.  Best of luck to everyone this year.
