<n>Caliph Hasim of Ivory Garden, known for testing Sultan Salazar's patience and power, received a harsh and deadly rebuke this week, as Sultanate forces swept in and ended a standoff at the Caliphate's main shipyards. The drama started ten days ago as Caliphate forces blockaded and took possession of the shipyard and its surrounding manufacturing plants, when a worker strike threatened production. After production resumed, the Caliph ordered his forces to remain in a bid to leverage funding transfer negotiations with the Sultan. Shipyard inventory and product was confiscated by Hasim's forces in the boldest display of defiance yet. The Sultan's concession to meet some of the Caliph's demands lead Hasim to believe the ploy to be effective. However, it appears to have been simply a delay tactic. Salazar's forces assaulted the occupied orbital facilities in a lightning attack eliminating Caliph Hasim's forces completely, forcing the Caliph to return home beaten, humiliated, and keenly aware of the limits of his power within the Sultanate.
