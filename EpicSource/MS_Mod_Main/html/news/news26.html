<n>Civil unrest and armed resistance to Imperial rule have plagued the system of Kronholm since it was annexed after the War of Dissolution over seventy years ago.  The resistance movement, calling itself “Kronholm Freedom Coalition”, has become more organized and well armed in the last few years, gaining the attention of Imperial security forces.  In a bid to simultaneously take control of three separate command and control facilities in Kronholm, the rebel forces met with much stronger Imperial defences than anticipated, and were wiped out at all three sites. A series of punitive raids by the Empire have smashed the bases of the KFC, weakening them even further. Kronholm's hopes for freedom from the oppression of Emperor Leung seem even more distant now, as they must turn to outsiders, now, to free them.
