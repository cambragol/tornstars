<n>The Fonseka Foundation, a collection of wealthy families dedicated to rebuilding the system of Lombard to its former greatness, have announced that the second reconstruction project they have funded is now nearly complete. With the opening of the second operational station in Lombard, they are another step closer to restoring a viable economy and permanent civil presence in that system, which was so profoundly damaged by the destruction of the War of Dissolution. The Foundation spokesperson has yet to announce the third project, as the second is only now open for settlement, but they have financial reserves to begin another construction project immediately, should they choose. A source from within Grinnel Shipping, who claims to have been consulted by the Foundation on this project, suggested that they reserve a good portion of their existing funds to create a permanent security force, to help stabilize the system. ‘Creating stability and the rule of law is more important at this point, than making more stations,' he said. Shares in the new stations are being made available at very low prices, in a bid to encourage business and industry to establish operations in or around these new stations.
