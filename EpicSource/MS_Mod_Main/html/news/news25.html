<n>In the same year, the Imperial shipyards in Li Po, Kronholm, and Xu Xuan combined, broke all records of production for interstellar vessels. The Naval shipyards have been going full shifts for over five years now, churning out more Corvette and Patrol Combatant sized vessels than ever before. This past year surpassed them all, placing a record number of armed vessels into service for the Imperial Navy. The neighbouring Emerald Alliance, as well as representatives from the Sultanate and the Dead Reaches systems all expressed concern that the Emperor is creating a difficult and precarious interstellar situation with such an egregious military build-up. Emperor Leung was recently quoted saying that the requirements for strong naval presence was merely for the protection of Imperial interests, assuring his neighbours that they needn't fear any hostilities if they abide by the agreements of the post-war pacts signed over fifty years ago.
