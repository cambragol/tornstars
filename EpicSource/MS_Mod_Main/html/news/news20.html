<n>Already known as the densest source of neutronium in the Middle States cluster, and the source of the great wealth enjoyed by the Sultanate, Al Wadi has become even richer than before. Undisclosed amounts of neutronium were recently located by a survey team while it was searching for new deposits of the essential compound. No one is saying how large this new find is, but a member of the survey crew was quoted as saying that the find was larger than anything they could have hoped for, and would take years to exploit. The news of this newfound wealth was greeted warmly by Sultan Salazar and his sister Karina at their opulent palace in New Constantinople. Reactions at the other end of the cluster were more…chilly. Emperor Leung's press secretary offered no comment on the find, but did mention their ongoing efforts to obtain neutronium by artificial means. He announced phase 2 trials of a new reactor prototype being developed at a state research facility located somewhere in Xu Xuan. To date, no substitute has been found that could successfully match the role played by neutronium in the reaction process, so from where the rest of us stand, it looks like the score is Sultanate: 1 – Empire: 0 for this round.
