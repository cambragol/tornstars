<n>The Emerald Alliance, already weakened by political in-fighting between Speaker Freund of Huang and Prime Speaker Holsworth, suffered another blow this week with the release of reports by an independent investigation into organized crime implicating Speaker Valenskaya. The Pimental organization has been a well-known criminal clan operating more or less freely within the Penda system for decades. Efforts to restore order and the rule of law have failed to make significant progress in the past four years resulting in a special investigations probe. Speaker Valenskaya flatly denied allegations that she has been receiving substantial financial subsidies from the Pimentals despite solid evidence of her culpability. While Speaker Valenskaya declined an interview, Prime Speaker Holsworth held a press this morning stating a strong desire of all member systems to maintain a high standard of ethics and accountability at all levels of government. He added that this was a bad time in the growth of the Alliance for political attacks and recriminations.
