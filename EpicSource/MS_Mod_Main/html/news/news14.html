<n>Reports of attacks on commercial and civilian shipping vessels in several systems of the Dead Reaches are up 18 percent from last year, according to the last Quarterly report of the Omnibus Insurance Company. System admin sources from Alcuin and Bedalov have reported that even though we are only six months into the year, they have already surpassed last year's total number of reported shipping losses. Authorities have expressed concern that organized crime, or pirate gangs are setting up operations in this region, possibly in unknown systems accessible through as-yet uncharted capsule space jump routes. These pirate operations are undermining efforts to stabilize trade and defence negotiations with the neighbouring Emerald Alliance. The problem has grown to the point where it has gained the attention of our neighbours, who are also affected. Speaker Freund of Huang told the Alliance senate that shipping between Powys and Alcuin was suffering enough to affect revenues in his system. Last week in a press conference, even Prime Speaker Holsworth of Emerald told reporters that <i>‘…the pirate problem in the Dead Reaches threatens all trade in the region. We will support any and all efforts to rid the neighbouring systems of this lawless scum. The senate will even consider sending an Alliance security fleet, if necessary.' </i>Corporate representatives from Azran could not be reached for comment. However, the executive branch of EtCom has officially stated that it will accept any offers of additional security. Representatives from the Doran Asteroid Mining Network have posted higher rewards for confirmed kills of any vessels from their ‘known pirate' list.
