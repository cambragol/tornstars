<n>Even during the height of the War of Dissolution, there were star systems in the Middle States where booming mining activity barely paused to take notice of the hostilities. The rest of the cluster was not so lucky, and it has taken a long time for the industry to reach what economists and planetary science experts alike describe as a healthy strength for viability. The demand for raw materials to supply the new manufacturing and refining boom have fueled a veritable 'ore rush' across the entire sector, encouraging prospectors and mining operations of every size to search, tag, drill, crush and haul all manner of mineral goods to the operational refineries. Prices are high so it should be an almost risk-free pursuit, right? “Wrong”, says Lars Magruder, a mining engineer in Watts. “The demand is high, and supply is growing steadily, but it is the refining industry that is proving to be the bottleneck in this new growth sector. Until more refineries are built or refurbished the mining industry is already nearly at capacity for the Middle States”. This hasn't slowed the growing number of prospectors out there banking on the riches promised by increased refining capacity planned by Doran Asteroid Mining Network, and its competitors.
