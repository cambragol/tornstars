<n>Ever since the jump route from T'Ang to Sirius went silent after the War, the previously well-mapped capsule jumps throughout the cluster have changed in subtle and mysterious ways. All but the most stable and well-traveled L-point jump routes have experienced small changes or shifts that have made a number of routes unpredictable, unstable or otherwise unsafe to use. This has meant that surveyors, scouts and explorers have had to re-map the entire cluster's L-point jump routes, a long and difficult process that has only just begun. Until recently no definitive proof has existed to link the Sirius Event to these capsule space jump route changes. A study conducted by the Stellar Research Division of the Markus Corporation shows that a subtle change in the values of the background radiation for this entire region of the galaxy, known to affect Capsule space routes in this cluster, occurred at the same time as the Sirius Event. This subtle change in the very fabric of the cosmos for this region of the universe may indeed be the essence of the Sirius Event, but more research is required before this can be known.
