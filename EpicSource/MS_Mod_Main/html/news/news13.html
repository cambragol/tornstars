<n>More than two months after vanishing in what was thought to be a failed Capsule space jump, the <i>Horatio Star </i>appeared nearly intact in the T'Ang system this week. The fully loaded Venice-class freighter was written off as lost with all hands by underwriters after the requisite 6-week waiting period passed, leading the Omnibus Insurance Company to investigate, concerned about the possibility of a fraud attempt. While the crew remain sequestered in a complete media blackout for duration of insurance investigations, initial reports suggest that the vessel experienced substantial damage during an attempted capsule space transit from Alcuin, resulting in loss of navigational data. The vessel apparently emerged safely from jump in an unknown star system where they were able to affect repairs and find their way to T'Ang following an unknown number of blind jumps. No doubt the crewmembers are counting their blessings at their good fortune, despite the house arrest in effect at present. They will likely be counting a good deal more soon, as cash offers for even partial information regarding new jump routes will be flooding their mail.
