<n>Otomo Corporation launched another probe from T'ang in an attempt to re-open the jump route to Sirius. If successful, this venture would have been the first time since the War of Dissolution that a vessel had successfully made FTL contact using the closed route. Unfortunately, the probe failed to respond to controllers' signals yesterday, and all contact with the probe was lost less than an hour later. This is the eighth official attempt to re-open the destroyed route in seventy years. Markus Otomo, CEO of the Markus Corporation continues to finance probe missions from this system, in hopes that discovering a route will revive travel and trade through T'ang, back to the Sol cluster. The reasons behind the loss of the LaGrange Navigational data during the War continues to be one of the most enigmatic mysteries of the post-war era. Theories abound, but answers are few regarding the cause for the loss of this crucial jump point, known as the Sirius Event. Astrogation specialists, astrophysicists, and stellar cartography researchers are all struggling with conflicting data regarding this blocked route.
