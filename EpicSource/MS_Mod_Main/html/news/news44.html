<n>Independent haulers hoping to make a few extra credits by shipping illegal goods may find themselves paying exorbitant fines, or worse, having their vessels impounded if they try to operate in the Dead Reaches. Local system authorities have recently signed an agreement that will strengthen their joint customs enforcement by allocating more ships and personnel to the jump points in most Dead Reach systems. While these systems have benefited from a largely unregulated trade and shipping in the past two decades, it has also brought with it criminal elements that are now posing more significant shipping problems and threaten economic stability, including an increase in armed conflicts in all areas of this region of the cluster. Customs vessels will be more visible, better armed, and empowered with greater authority in their bid to bring this region under the rule of law. Smugglers be warned: The profit margin just got thinner and the risks, higher.
