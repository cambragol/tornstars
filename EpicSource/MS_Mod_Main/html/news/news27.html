<n>The Leung Empire has stationed at least two large battle groups of the Imperial Navy in the Li Po system, and a suspected three more are mustering in Xu Xuan under the pretence of ‘military training exercises', and defending against the threat of the so-called Brethren in nearby Ripon. However, sources from with the Emerald Alliance have made it clear that this threat to Providence and the entire Alliance is being taken very seriously. While the Emerald Alliance Navy lacks the sheer strength needed to match the Emperor's fleet, they have made it clear that they will hire mercenary forces, and seek military coalitions with the Corliss Conglomerate, and the systems of the Dead Reaches, should such steps be required. Official diplomatic protests sent by the Alliance have received no response from the Empire, as yet.
