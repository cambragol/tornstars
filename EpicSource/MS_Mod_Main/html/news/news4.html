<n>Scientific journals rarely send ripples across the entire cluster, but the findings published in last month's Micro-G Engineering and Technology have made everyone sit up and take notice. The study conducted in government funded research labs in Xu Xuan have demonstrated a new process for refining Neutronium that requires less energy and yields more of the refined material. More striking than the article's findings is the fact that it was published at all. It is widely believed that the research laboratories of the Leung Empire have been working in secret to uncover a synthetic substitute for Neutronium for the past forty years. Scientists in Mustapha Institute and the University of Tulun are speculating that a message is being sent to the Sultanate that its monopoly on neutronium production is nearing an end.
