<n>Vessels identified as Takanan Raiders have been spotted in remote regions of both Nisami and Nureddin systems, according to a series of independent accounts. The Raiders, older assault vessels bearing the markings of Admiral Takana's once-revered 14th cruisers, were confirmed to be present by several sources within Nisami earlier this week, and again in Nureddin yesterday, sparking fears of renewed violence in the region. Corliss Militia spokesperson Gerhard Wendt speculated that the Raiders may be expanding their searches for supplies, parts and personnel after having stripped the system of Hant of anything useful. Police patrols have been reinforced in the sectors where the sightings occurred, and commercial shipping has been issued renewed warnings of the risks involved in transiting these systems unescorted.
