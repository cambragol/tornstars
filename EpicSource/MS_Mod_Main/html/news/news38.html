<n>The Aikenites, long known for their industrious repairs to the smashed infrastructure in the Barrens, have restored power and atmosphere to yet another orbital depot in the Lombard system. There was no press release, no ceremony, no announcement of any kind to mark the completion of their third refurbished station, just the sounds of comms returning to a region of space left dead silent after the War of Dissolution. The unassuming repair crews simply activated the station's systems, registered the station as operational for navigational purposes, and moved on to the next project, leaving only a small maintenance team aboard. Officials in the Consolidated Mining Corporation responded with charges of theft, tampering, and illegal occupation of ‘decommissioned assets'. These charges, in the past have lead to little or no action on the part of the CMC, and the Aikenites continue to use these orbitals to support their own operations, as well as to encourage a general return of business and shipping to the region. Unfortunately, piracy and other criminal activity still pose a significant problem for the rebirth of Lombard.
