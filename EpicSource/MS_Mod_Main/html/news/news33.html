<n>The Consolidated Mining Company controlled administration of Watts turned the war of words up a notch today, following yesterday's attack on the Corliss diplomatic mission established on the Daltry station near Sutter. After being accused of orchestrating the attack, the CMC closed their embassy at Fallis, in the Corliss system and recalled their diplomatic staff. The recent period of peace between the CMC and the Corliss Conglomerate, which has been fragile at best, is close to collapsing completely for the first time in almost a decade. Earlier this month, a group of six armed raider vessels launched an attack on the Corliss embassy, coming close to destroying it before being forced to break off and flee by defence forces. The Corliss Conglomerate, unable to confirm the identity of the raiders, closed their consular offices and accused the CMC of hiring mercenaries to destabilize relations and undermine their efforts to create a lasting peace. Corliss representatives claimed that this is another in a series of subtle but ongoing forms of harassment implemented by the CMC. Director Murcheson of the CMC was unavailable for comment, but it is rumoured that he is scheduled to meet directly with Director Mastrantonio of the Corliss Conglomerate in a last ditch effort to avoid direct and open hostilities.
