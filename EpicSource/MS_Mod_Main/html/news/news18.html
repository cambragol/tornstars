<n>Authorities for the Space Traffic Control Commission of Emerald expressed their displeasure to the Local Commerce Coalition Board at the change in shipping routes being used by an increasing number of registered commercial freighter vessels bound for the Nisami-Watts corridor and points beyond. Shipping routes typically take cargo vessels from Emerald through Providence. However, recent changes in freighter routes for Azran, Chavez, and a number of Independent carriers heading out of the system are taking them in an entirely new direction unknown to local STC authorities. The change in traffic pattern, while yielding striking profits for those few companies making use of the unknown route, has caused problems in traffic management and loss of income for customs and duty officials. Emerald System Officials promise thorough investigations of the unknown route or routes, and their announced their intentions to recover lost revenues. They also warn that use of unregistered routes may result in costlier potential shipping losses should any mishap occur.
