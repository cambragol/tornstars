<n>In a bid to reduce shipping losses, and perhaps to appear benevolent, the largest insurance company in the cluster has recently released all of the information it has about the known hazards in the Epitaph system to most system Traffic Control authorities. The system was seeded with every manner of hazard to shipping from simple proximity mine fields, to automated aggressor particle beam platforms, to the hastily recruited and reprogrammed industrial mining equipment that was operating there at the time of the war. While still scant in details and full of guesswork, the information includes the sum of their research over the past decade about types of weapons platforms, minefields and other automated equipment that may still be operational and hostile to any shipping in that system. Estimates include how many of the deadly machines may have ceased to function over the decades, or malfunctioned, or simply exhausted their ordnance. The research also addressed other navigational hazards, such as the known radiation, ionization, and gas cloud hazards, and how they may have changed in recent years. Even though it has been several decades since the end of the war, the Epitaph system was the largest battleground, and site of the most death and destruction of all the Middle States systems. While it may be useful to some, the information released leaves too many gaps for anyone to make safe predictions of what routes to try. It has, however, allowed the Omnibus company to estimate risk and chances of safe transit. Suffice it to say the any and all insurance policies are nullified the moment anyone sets their capsule jump coordinates to this system. Insurance or not, the dangers remains far too high for this writer to be making any travel plans through Epitaph anytime soon.
