<n>Top Stellar cartographers, Navigational experts and Capsule Space physicists met this week at the Khalilistan Technological Institute (Khal Tech) in Ivory Garden to discuss the Sirius Event, and how it may have affected navigation in local space. While much of the effects remain a mystery, one thing is clear: the map of the Middle States cluster is changing. More and more jump routes are being discovered weekly. While most of these capsule space jump routes remain almost un-navigable, unstable or extremely hazardous, many of them are use-able. The routes that have been deemed useful are much less 'simple' to use than the major routes that have been in use as main jump points in the cluster, but transits can be made with acceptable levels of risk. Even more interesting is the possibility that new star systems that were previously inaccessible may become part of our new map. Some of these systems may even already be in use by illegal operations. Time, considerable exploration efforts, and investment in infrastructure will be needed before any new systems are truly opened up for colonization, but the possibility has explorers, venture capitalists, utopian dreamers and malcontents all eager for the green light to push out the boundaries of Human occupied space.
