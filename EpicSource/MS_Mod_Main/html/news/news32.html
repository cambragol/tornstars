<n>Ever since the 14th cruisers were defeated and disbanded during the War of Dissolution, the remnants of this group have pirated and raided shipping in the Hant system. Under the leadership of their former commander, Admiral Takana, the so-called ‘Takanan Raiders' have plagued commercial and naval shipping in this key system for decades, harming trade and economic growth in the region. In an unprecedented attack, the Takanan Raiders were seen raiding shipping in Nureddin, bringing their menace closer to the home of Caliph Al Hazen. In a rare appearance, he stated that this attack only confirms his conviction that a serious effort must be undertaken to send an expedition to Hant for the sole purpose of eliminating the Takanan Threat once and for all.  New funds were announced for the hiring of mercenaries interested in joining the expedition.
