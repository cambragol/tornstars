<n>Our Bright Shining Star, Emperor Leung wanted to throw an unforgettable celebration for his loyal people during the recent annual festivities to commemorate the founding of the Middle Kingdom. Unfortunately, angry dissidents from Kronholm had other plans  choosing instead to sew death and destruction. The 97th anniversary celebrations were to include a rare public appearance by the Emperor from the main palace courtyard for as many as 25,000 onlookers. Palace Guard security planners were forced to make changes to the festivities after 48 people were brutally killed and scores injured in a bombing at a transit tube station near the main palace. While security forces are investigating, and have already made a number of arrests, they believe the terrorist attack was a botched job, with the explosive device detonating a full day earlier than planned. The damage would have been much worse if it had occurred during the celebrations held today. A Kronholm separatist rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack. The effects on the festivities were minimized by quick response by security forces, and an unsympathetic populace. Long Live Emperor Leung.
