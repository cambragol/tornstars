<n>Representatives from Bedalov, Alcuin, Powys and Bumpy's Star, as well as representatives from a number of local commercial interests, traveled together to Emerald yesterday in a rare display of solidarity. A spokesperson for the mission was quick to insist that the delegation would be discussing trade relations only, but since Prime Speaker Holsworth, Head of Emerald's House of Representatives announced a desire to welcome more systems into the Alliance last month, it is clear that politics will be a part of this week's negotiations as well. Conspicuous in their absence was a representative from the T'Ang system. The office of the Trade Commission for the T'Ang government declined to comment.
