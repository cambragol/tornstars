<n>It may be the first case of Necrotizing Mucosa Syndrome in almost fifty years, if reports of an outbreak of the fatal disease are confirmed in the Bedalov system. Details are scarce, but it is feared that a salvage team returning from Powys may have unknowingly become infected while evaluating an abandoned station in that once devastated system.  Half a century ago, this virulent infection spread rapidly through every ship and station in the Powys system, leaving thousands dead, and an entire star system under strict quarantine. Citizens of Powys, desperate to escape, were wiped out by the shipload if they tried to break quarantine. It is even rumoured that several ships loaded with refugees exited the Powys system in the direction of Huang using only LDS drives, determined and desperate to cross the interstellar distances by any means. Such a journey would take decades to complete, and no such ‘slow boats' have been sighted as yet. The quarantine was enforced with ruthless rigour at every interstellar jump point connected to Powys until it was lifted sixteen years ago. 
<br>
The Powys system has just begun to recover, after the official quarantine was carefully lifted. A new outbreak of NMS could halt all interstellar trade in the region. While officials are quick to point out that the infection has been contained, fears and rumours are rapidly spreading of a new plague that could harm our economy, obstruct our efforts to join with the Emerald Alliance, and reverse the first year of accelerating population growth in decades. A temporary reinstatement of the Powys quarantine is likely to be announced soon. Any ships intending to travel there are advised against doing so.
