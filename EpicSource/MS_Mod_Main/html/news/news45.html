<n>In an exclusive EtCom investigative journalism report, Emerald military vessel activity has shown a subtle but clear pattern of preparation for action in the Penda system. The Emerald Alliance has denied any plans for coordinated militia activity, claiming that the increased activity in Penda is for training exercises only. Prime Speaker Holsworth, suffering the challenges posed by internal struggles in the Alliance, has indicated that organized criminal activity within the Alliance would no longer be tolerated in any form. He would not confirm or deny the allegations that the recent gathering of armed military vessels in Penda were a show of force to the Pimental clan. The organized crime family appears to be aware of the threat as well, changing their patterns to fewer, but more powerfully grouped strikes at local shipping targets. At present, there have been no changes in policy, or reported hostilities between the criminals and the military. However, the main Pimental clan bases appear to be gathering more forces to themselves in preparation for armed defensive missions.
