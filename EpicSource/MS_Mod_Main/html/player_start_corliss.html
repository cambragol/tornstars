You are starting with the most basic of commercial ships, the 'Truck'.  You have worked hard, for years, slaving away at dead end jobs on the Corliss Trade Station in the Corliss system.  At last though, the ship you ordered has arrived, and you are free to make your fortune amongst the stars.  With you come your most trusted comrades in misfortune, Lori and Azraelle who will aid you in navigation, communications and engineering.

<P>
You still have 15000 credits in your account with which you hope to get started with some basic mineral hauling, or intrastellar station to station transport.  Corliss is situated only the major trade route between the Leung Empire, the Emerald Alliance and the Sultanate, so with some savy, luck and the right connections it shouldn't be too hard to build up a very nice and profitable trade route.
