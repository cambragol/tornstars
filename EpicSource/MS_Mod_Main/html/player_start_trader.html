You are starting with the most basic of freight ships, the 'Anderson SNRV'.  You have worked hard, for years, slaving away at dead end jobs on the Azran Shipbuilding station in the Azran system.  At last though, the ship you ordered has arrived, and you are free to make your fortune amongst the stars.  With you come your most trusted comrades in misfortune, Lori and Azraelle who will aid you in navigation, communications and engineering.

<P>
You still have 20000 credits in your account with which you hope to get started with some basic mineral hauling, or intrastellar station to station transport.  You will also need to consider hiring a wingman for protection, though you might need to save up a few credits before you can afford that.  You will need to tread carefully in these 'Dead Reaches' lest you bankrupt yourself and end up without a ship, once again trapped on one of the forsaken metal boxes that pass for the homes of humanity in this cluster.
