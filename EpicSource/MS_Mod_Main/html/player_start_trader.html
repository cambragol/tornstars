You are starting with a small fleet of ships, including both 10 and 20 pod freighters, a mid-sized fuel transporter, and two wingmen.

You are currently positioned outside of Stohl Common Metals Mine, owned by Imperial Mining, with which you are on very good terms.  You are also quite friendly with Azran Corporation.  Nearby are 35 pods of Phosphorus, waiting for delivery.  Take them to Imperial Mining's Fei Hong moon Processing Facility in Xu Xuan.  Once that is done you should be well on your way to some heavy duty trading.
