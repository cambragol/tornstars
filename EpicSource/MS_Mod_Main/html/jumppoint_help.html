Jump Point Sensors
<hr>
<p>This sensor package allows your ship to find and use unmarked jump points. 
Unmarked jump points are often unguarded or lead to new unexplored systems.

<p>Moon List
<br>
Every jump point exists half way between a moon and a planet. 
This menu lists all the moons in the current system. 
When you press a button a navigation marker is placed at the same
location where a jump point might be found. Not every moon will have
a working jump point. You need to travel to each possible location
and run a sensor scan.

<p>Scanning</p>
<br>
Scanning uses your sensors to reveal any nearby jump points (100km range). 
Once a jump point is visible, you can use it to capsule jump to another system.

<p>Activate Jump</p>
<br>
Pressing Activate will prepare your ship for capsule jump using a nearby jump point (100km range). 
After pressing activate, you need to fly through the jump point, just like a standard lpoint.
Your ship must be traveling beween 500m/s and 1000m/s when you get withing 1km of the jump point.

<br>If you leave the jump location, you will need to activate the jump point again when you arrive.
