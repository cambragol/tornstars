Navigation Screen
<hr>
<p>This GUI lists all known, navigable objects and locations in the Middle States.

<p>Objects and locations are first sorted by system, and thereafter by object/location type.

<p>Selectable filters are included to allow the player to view only the types of objects/locations they are interested in.

<p>The main filters are:<br>
<br>
 - Show all<br>
 - Favourites<br>
 - Stations<br>
 - L-Points<br>
 - Planets<br>

<p>Secondary filters allow sorting of ships and fleets which are broadcasting their location.
<p>You can add and remove entries to the favourites section by clicking the 'Add to Favourites' and 'Remove from Favourites' buttons.</p>
