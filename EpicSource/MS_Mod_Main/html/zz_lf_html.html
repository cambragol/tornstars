Navigation Screen
<hr>
<p>The original mod adds a Navigation screen to the single player game that
shows a list of all stations and lagrange points in a solar system in alphabetical order, 
making it easy to find a particular location.</p>
<p>When you've found a location in the list, you can then
set a waypoint for the location and use the autopilot to take you there.</p>
<p>This enhancement adds filters to Navigation, 
allowing the player to view subsections of the locations available. 
The filters are:<br>
 - Show all<br>
 - Favourites<br>
 - Stations<br>
 - L-Points<br>
 - Destroyed Stations<br>
 - Underworld
</p>
<p>You can add and remove entries to the favourites section by clicking the 'Add to Favourites' and 'Remove from Favourites' buttons.</p>
<p>Original Created by Stephen Robertson, enhancements by Zazicle, converted to Epic by GrandpaTrout.</p>
