;
; This file defines a new Pog Class object Wreck Belt
;
; The Pog Objects are similar to ships and other 
; objects that use an INI control file to set
; properties. You can create as many different
; objects as you like, each one using the same
; or different control files.

; so go ahead and make a control file for each kind of 
; asteroid belt. This example uses all the inert
; asteroid types to make a mixed size belt.

;this is the number of threat points per wreck placed. A battle might destroy a few 
; hundred threat points worth of ships. The lower the number, the more wrecks, the higher
; the number the less wrecks. If a tug has a threat of 65 and you set this number to 65
; then you would get one wreck object for each tug destroyed. 
threat_value=100



; controls how tightly packed the asteroids are. Use a 1
; for scattered fields (default) or higher numbers for
; tightly packed fields. 10 is the max value.
; Flux scatters asteroids packed too tightly, so above
; some number, the field will not get more dense.
