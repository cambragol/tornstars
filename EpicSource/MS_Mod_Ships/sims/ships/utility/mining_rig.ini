; This is the fuel used in one jump
; mining rigs don't carry capsule drives, but this value is here for completeness.
jump_fuel=100

; this is the amount of fuel per day the ship burns just running.
; total days of fuel is max_fuel/daily_fuel

;This is the daily number of credits charged by the mining rig to
; pay maint and salries.

;The miner property allows a ship to mine or on player asteroids.
;The value is the cost per day of operating the mine, above any other
;upkeep costs.
miner=100

;This is the number of pods per day that the mining rig can harvest from
; a mine of 1 richness. More costly and better operated rigs are more
; efficient than inexpensive or poorly staffed rigs.
;Mines can have up to a 3 richness, so multiply by 3. 
; And most mines support 3 rigs, so increase by that amount for 
; maximum pods per day.
