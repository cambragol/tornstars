; Sensor range (sense within 10km)

; Explode radius (explode within 100m)
explode_radius=150

; Blast radius (damage to 500m)
blast_radius=600

; Proximity mine? - No we seek.
proximity = 0;

;
; N.B. As damage is linearly attenuated with distance to the target over 
; blast radius the maximum damage this weapon could do (provided a sim is
; caught at 300m ) is 
;
; damage * (1 - (explode_radius / blast_radius ) )
;
; Hence at 300m => 400  * ( 1 - (300 / 1000) ) = 400 * 0.7 = 280.  So it
; would have the same power at 300m as a contact weapon with damage 280.
;
; I'll try and find sometime to make this explode radius independent later
; For the moment if you get stuck come and see me.
