Change Your Identity
<hr>
<p>
Erasing your identity will allow you a fresh start in the Middle States. 
Genetic restructuring and organ transplants allow you to take on the identity 
of a kidnapped citizen of The Dead Reaches.
<p>
Your faction standings will be reset. 
You will lose all your upgraded factions, 
but you will also no longer be at Open War with any Governments or Corporations. 
<p>
Your current ship will be sold 
(to prevent it being traced to your new identity) 
and you will be taken inside the station and given a life pod.
<p>
You must have a Friendly or better faction standing with the faction who 
own the Pirate Base where you are erasing your identity.
