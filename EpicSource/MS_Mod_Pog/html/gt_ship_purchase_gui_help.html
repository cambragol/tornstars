Purchase Ship
<hr>
<p> 
You can replace or upgrade your ship at stations that support a ship dealer.
<p> 
These stations are the Shipyard, Waystation, Mercenary Base, and the System Defense Dock.
<p> 
The ships available for sale are listed on the upper left. Click on a ship for a description. The price of the ship and your current funds are listed below the ships. 
<p> 
Press the Buy Ship button to purchase the new ship. Your old ship will be sold. You will be taken inside the station where you can change the loadout of your new ship. You may only own one ship at a time.
<p> 
You can sell your current ship if you choose. You will be taken inside the station and provided with a life pod.
<p> 
Launch from the station to begin using your new ship.
