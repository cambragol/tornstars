Cargo

The key issue for cargo items is that there is only exactly as many as the 
enumeration. For this reason, you can use a fixed function to convert from 
a text name to a cargo type. And that is really how you must do it.

the type is stored in Object.IntProperty(cargo,"type");


Cargo Pods

Properties
cargo enumeration value = Object.IntProperty(pod,"cargo"

that special shipper faction is stored as the allegiance value 
Object.IntProperty(pod,"cargo_faction"
