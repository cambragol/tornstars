;
; This file defines a new Pog Class object Asteroid Belt
;
; The Pog Objects are similar to ships and other 
; objects that use an INI control file to set
; properties. You can create as many different
; objects as you like, each one using the same
; or different control files.

; so go ahead and make a control file for each kind of 
; asteroid belt. This example uses all the inert
; asteroid types to make a mixed size belt.

; Another could use red objects. Another could mix 
; red and rock, or rock and debris, or rocks and
; cargo pods.

; controls how tightly packed the asteroids are. Use a 1
; for scattered fields (default) or higher numbers for
; tightly packed fields. 10 is the max value.
; Flux scatters asteroids packed too tightly, so above
; some number, the field will not get more dense.
